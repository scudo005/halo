# System-link lockstep desync: client/server random seed mismatch

Status: **OPEN** (2026-09-11). The mixed-build system-link desync remains
unfixed and its original cause is not proven. The current evidence points to a
small pre-sweep projectile/placement divergence that can amplify into later
animation RNG draw-count differences; it does **not** establish that animation
code is the first cause. The historical run notes below are retained, but the
older top-level claim that the issue reproduces without combat and therefore
cannot involve projectile handling is superseded by the September 9--11
captures.

## September 11 current state and resume point

### Confirmed

- Test topology: two bridged xemu instances on the same interface. The client
  is `10.0.0.21` (HMP `127.0.0.1:4444`); the host is now `10.0.0.25` (HMP
  `127.0.0.1:4446`). Both VMs are currently paused after capture `ds53`.
- The apparent host-side input bleed is not duplicated input slots. In `ds49`,
  `network_game_client_end_frame` action probes (kinds 43--45) show two local
  players but only slot 0 contains the grenade buttons (`0x3000`); the same
  authoritative remote action is rendered on both peers. Packet parsing or an
  input ACK failure is therefore not the leading hypothesis.
- The RNG mismatch is a downstream symptom. In the current traces, the first
  meaningful sequence difference is around tick 5276 in
  `model_animation_choose_random`: the host makes three draws while the client
  makes two, alongside client-only `0x00 -> 0x18` animation transitions. The
  `unit_select_movement_on_state` audit explains how a successful state call can skip a second
  chooser draw, but does not identify the earlier cause.
- `ds49`: at grenade release, acceleration is bit-identical, but the client’s
  projectile position already differs before the first sweep by about
  `0.026546955` on X. `FUN_000f8720` is consequently downstream of the initial
  state difference in this capture.
- `ds52`: paired thrower-position probes are bit-identical on both peers, as is
  acceleration. The first sweep nevertheless differs by about `0.027083` on X;
  the later `FUN_000f90d0` RNG draws occur after that divergence and are not its
  source.
- `ds53`: the raw unit position differs by only 1 ULP on X and 2 ULP on Y;
  `unit_set_seat_state` and the final throw target preserve those small deltas.
  The first sweep differs by about `0.00966358` on X. This makes amplification
  after target construction, likely in `object_try_place` / `FUN_0014df70`, the
  current actionable lead. `biped_estimate_position` mode 0 calls
  `object_get_world_position` and only changes Z, so it cannot explain the X
  divergence in this path.
- The `ds51` run staying synchronized for a while is inconclusive: the watcher
  waited long enough for the trace ring to wrap, so it is not evidence of a
  fix.

### Inferred

- A one- to few-draw LCG distance is consistent with peers taking different
  animation/transition branches after a floating-point or collision-placement
  difference, rather than with a corrupted seed or a serializer failure.
- The grenade path is currently the best reproducible trigger, but that does
  not prove grenades are the only trigger or that collision placement is the
  original divergence. A pre-sweep state difference still needs to be located.

### Current accuracy work (not runtime validation)

The retained source improvements include `network_game_client_end_frame`
95.3%, `player_register_machine` 94.3%, `network_game_spawn_player` 98.0%,
`unit_set_seat_state` 99.3% (150/152, operand 94.0%),
`biped_estimate_position` 93.2% gate-safe (141/140, operand 89.7%),
`object_translate` 100.0% (55/55, operand 96.4%),
`FUN_000f90d0` 81.2% gate-safe (939/899, operand 58.7%),
`unit_throw_grenade_release` 86.9% gate-safe (249/248, operand 76.1%),
`object_try_place` 95.7% (operand 82.2%), and `FUN_0014df70` 92.8%
(540/555, operand 66.3%). The `FUN_0014df70` gain came from four verified
BSP/object timing/logging calls. The seat-state improvement retains the
verified memcpy vector-copy shapes and signed int16 seat-index arguments; its
remaining two instructions are a branch-layout difference, with no semantic,
call, or offset mismatch. The biped-position improvement retains the verified
12-byte `memcpy` of `estimated_body_position`; a 98.9% trial was rejected
because it introduced two new FPU warnings. Mode 0 still only calls
`object_get_world_position` and changes Z, so it cannot generate the observed
X/Y divergence. These are VC71 instruction-match results, not proof of
behavioral equivalence or a desync fix. `object_translate` is now an exact
55/55 match after retaining one binary-backed 12-byte `memcpy` to `obj+0x0c`,
matching the original integer dword copy; the whole `objects.c` gate rose
4.6pp with no warnings or regressions. `FUN_000f90d0` retains the exact
12-byte collision-position `memcpy`; its
whole `projectiles.c` gate rose 0.2pp with no warning regression, and the
hazard scan is clean apart from existing reviewed warnings. The remaining
mismatch is broad local-frame/lifetime/register/x87 shape (candidate frame
`0x114` versus reference `0xe4`), not a proven call-condition bug. Because
this function is downstream, differing RNG counts can reflect differing
incoming collision/tag state. The sequential Sol Medium accuracy campaign is
still in progress; do not treat an intermediate score or an
unbuilt candidate as deployed behavior. No coherent client RNG-trace XBE
containing the latest accuracy changes has been deployed yet.

The second-pass accuracy review classified the remaining candidates as follows:

- `object_try_place` 95.7% / 82.2% is exhausted for now: no semantic, call,
  or collision-buffer mismatch was found.
- `FUN_000f9c40` 89.2% / 65.5% preserves the `collision_result+0x50` and
  `FUN_000f8720`/`FUN_000f90d0` argument order and bounce increment; the
  residual is frame/register/x87 shape.
- `unit_select_movement_on_state` 80.9% / 58.6% preserves the exact state `0x18` gate and
  draw-suppression path; the residual is switch/control/register shape.
- `FUN_000f8720` 69.3% / 58.1% preserves calls, flags, buffers, and cross
  direction; the residual is x87 scheduling/interleaving/register allocation.

No second-pass code change was retained for these functions. A low byte-match
score alone should not redirect the runtime diagnosis without contradictory
evidence. All score figures remain static accuracy evidence, not runtime
validation of the desync fix.

### Uncertain / superseded

- The exact first writer of the projectile position discrepancy remains
  unknown. The current placement/LOS lead is a hypothesis pending a probe at
  the relevant call boundary.
- Earlier sections that describe a combat-free reproduction, or that exclude
  projectile handling solely from that observation, are historical observations
  from earlier runs and are no longer a safe summary of the issue.
- Raw RDCP access from WSL works for these Windows xemu instances, although the
  repository helper has intermittently timed out. The xemu HDD `init.txt` files
  were removed; future deployments should remain XBE-only and must not restore
  them.

### Resume procedure

1. Let the sequential accuracy campaign finish and record its final gated
   scores; keep only binary-backed, warning-free candidates.
2. Build one coherent trace XBE from the resulting worktree:
   `rtk wsl.exe bash -lc 'cd /mnt/g/dev/halo && /usr/bin/python3 tools/build/build.py -q --rng-trace --target patched_xbe'`.
3. Deploy the client XBE only to `10.0.0.21`. Keep the original probe XBE on
   `10.0.0.25` if its probes are unchanged; do not deploy `init.txt`.
4. Reproduce the same one- or two-grenade sequence and arm the lockstep watcher
   before input. Compare trace kinds 43--51, especially thrower/seat/final
   positions and the first sweep result, using client ring VA `0x80ed54` and
   host ring VA `0x7ff900`.
5. If the first sweep still diverges, add narrowly scoped pre/post
   `object_try_place` or `FUN_0014df70` outcome probes and repeat. Only after
   locating that boundary should animation-state callers or safe ABI-aware
   toggles be bisected.

Relevant captures are under `artifacts/rng_trace/`: `ds49_action_slots_trace.json`,
`ds49_action_slots_host_trace.json`, `ds50_throw_unit_pos_host_trace.json`,
`ds51_throw_unit_both_trace.json`, `ds51_throw_unit_both_host_trace.json`,
`ds52_two_grenades_trace.json`, `ds52_two_grenades_host_trace.json`,
`ds53_seat_vs_final_trace.json`, and `ds53_seat_vs_final_host_trace.json`.

## September 6: animation-path accuracy audit

The paired trace's first extra draw is in `model_animation_choose_random`,
following a client animation-state transition. This prioritizes
`unit_animation_set_state`, `unit_update_animation`, their transition helper
`FUN_001a86b0`, and the animation update/set wrappers. It does not establish
which earlier state update caused the two machines to diverge.

The VC71 comparison parser was truncating valid cold switch arms after an
early return. Its whole-object path collected label positions but did not
pass label names to the existing back-edge-aware trimming routine. This
discarded 86 real instructions and eight calls in `unit_animation_set_state`.
`tools/verify/compare_obj.py` now passes those names; four regression tests in
`tools/verify/test_compare_obj_disassembly.py` cover cold arms, offset labels,
real trailing tables, and neighboring functions. Existing self-tests pass.
The historical 76.8% setter score below is therefore superseded by an
**83.9506% corrected baseline**, before any source improvement.

| Function | Corrected baseline | After source change | Binary-backed change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `model_animation_choose_random` | 98.2759% | 100.0000% | Return `int16_t`, matching `MOV AX, SI` at `0x120fc0`; all 14 direct callers checked. |
| `unit_animation_set_state` | 83.9506% | 87.2629% | Reload the animation graph tag index at the original call sites instead of caching it across calls. |
| `unit_update_animation` | 90.3790% | 92.8047% | Remove a redundant switch range guard and restore the nested matrix-call argument evaluation shape. |

These are VC71 instruction-match scores, not raw byte identity or runtime
equivalence. The chooser's final operand score is 96.5517%. Each kept source
candidate passed its complete translation-unit regression gate (208 functions
in `units.c`, 23 in `model_animations.c`) without missing functions, lowered
neighbor scores, or increased warnings. The knowledge-base change is limited
to the chooser's return type; parameter and register annotations are unchanged.

Other inspected functions: `biped_update_dispatcher` 89.8596%, `FUN_001ab870` 96.7742%,
`unit_set_animation` 95.5% with ABI modeling, and `FUN_001a86b0` 100%.
No speculative source edits were made to these functions. In particular,
the transition helper's perfect VC71 result does not cover its deployed clang
EDX live-out mismatch described below. That mismatch invalidates some partial
original/ported animation experiments, but has not been shown to cause the
normal fully patched build's desync.

Source accuracy improved; **the mixed-build desync remains open**. The next
runtime comparison must use coherent builds and capture both animation probe
histories at the first differing RNG draw, before the later disconnect.

Final validation: the combined units and model gates pass after the return-type
correction. The isolated `halo-rng-models` clang build with `HALO_RNG_TRACE=ON`
completed `tools/build/build.py -q --rng-trace --target patched_xbe` successfully.
The changed-file hazard scan has no new findings; the updater's duplicate
arguments match the original's intentional in-place vector operations.
The exhaustive RNG test still has zero binary32 and x87-result mismatches for
all 65,536 outputs at both tested precision settings. Baselines, candidate
ledgers, combined gates, and exact source hashes are retained under
`artifacts/rng_trace/accuracy/`. The new XBE has not been deployed.

## Symptom

A system-link game between a pristine build-2276 host (`cachebeta.xbe`,
xemu at 10.0.0.24) and our re-implemented client (`halo-patched/default.xbe`,
xemu at 10.0.0.21) can desync at startup or later during active gameplay:

    out of sync: client/server random seed mismatch, update= #N ... (#client/#server)

Reproduces **without any combat** (no shots, no grenades, no explosions), so
the divergence is not in the damage/projectile path. Reproduction matrix:

| host       | client     | result |
|------------|------------|--------|
| cachebeta  | cachebeta  | in sync |
| reimpl     | reimpl     | in sync |
| cachebeta  | reimpl     | **desync** |

The client's seed distance from the server is always a small number of draws
(1 behind, 1 ahead, 2 behind), sometimes self-correcting a tick later. This is
a draw-count drift, not a corrupted seed.

## Mechanism

Lockstep determinism depends on both machines drawing from the global seed
(`0x46e3f4`, LCG `s*0x19660d+0x3c6ef35f`) the same number of times per tick.
Every draw is traced by the `HALO_RNG_TRACE` ring (`docs/rng-trace.md`), plus
"info" probes (kinds 15-18) that record animation state transitions without
touching the seed.

Trace analysis (`artifacts/rng_trace/a8_immediate.json`,
`a9_animation.json`, decoded with `tools/xbox/rng_trace_dump.py --probes`):

- Every seed mismatch coincides with an **animation** RNG draw:
  `model_animation_choose_random` (0x120f20) called either from the original
  `animation_update_internal` (0x121c30, unported) when an animation
  completes and re-randomizes, or from `unit_animation_set_state` (0x1ad260)
  when a unit changes animation state.
- a8: tick 66 client one draw behind, catches up at tick 67.
- a9: tick 97 unit `e2aa003b` transitions state 6 -> 0. Client draws twice
  (main anim + weapon idle: `e43aa3da`, `30fc2171` -> `7298ac1c`); server sits
  at `30fc2171`, one draw behind the client. Ticks 217-228 client two behind.
- So one side reaches an animation completion or state change one tick
  earlier than the other. The random draw itself is correct; its **timing**
  differs.

## Continuation: RNG reciprocal and runtime isolation

The plane store/reload correction in `FUN_0010a1c0` is present in commit
`e56821009`. A fresh traced build with that correction (XBE SHA-256 prefix
`5e5918c93c87c078`) was deployed to `10.0.0.21` and its running build identity
verified. Against the pristine host, it survived idle play, movement, and a
kill, then desynced following grenades at tick **3842**. The client seed
`143582d7` was four LCG steps behind the host's `ccf76ffb`. Therefore the plane
correction is **not sufficient** to fix system-link determinism. The capture
has no seed-continuity breaks:
`artifacts/rng_trace/roundtrip_failure_20260905.json` and
`roundtrip_client_pass_20260905.txt`.

Temporary patcher overlays, without changing `kb.json`, gave these results:

| Original implementations selected on client | XBE SHA-256 prefix | First mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| `unit_update_animation`, `unit_animation_set_state`, `FUN_001ab870`, `unit_set_animation`, `model_animation_choose_random`, `biped_update_dispatcher` | `71e43043639337ed` | tick 3 |
| `unit_update_animation`, `unit_animation_set_state`, `biped_update_dispatcher` | `2c823d7f7ea0cc91` | tick 3 |
| `unit_animation_set_state` only | `ade116bad2eaaf83` | tick 1840, following grenades |

Original entry bytes and implementation deactivation redirects were verified
over XBDM, with the still-patched plane function as a positive control. The
standard QMP gate was unavailable. The immediate-failure variants repeatedly
selected animation `-1` once per player per tick; this is a different failure
pattern and **does not rule out** the animation callers or their remaining
ported dependencies. Restoring the original state setter alone did not fix
the grenade reproduction. Captures are named `animation_original_20260905`,
`animation_three_20260905`, and `animation_setter_20260905` under
`artifacts/rng_trace/`.

### Confirmed numeric bug in `random_math_real` (0x10b240)

The original instruction at **0x10b268** is
`fmul dword ptr [0x2647f4]`. That constant is binary32 **0x37800080**,
approximately `1.5259021893143654e-5`. The lifted C divided by `65535.0f`, and
the shipping clang object emitted `fdiv`, so it computed a different value
despite advancing the seed correctly. The correction is:

```c
return (float)(s >> 16) * *(float *)0x2647f4;
```

`tools/verify/rng_real_native.py` compiles complete translation units with and
without the correction, extracts their actual function instructions, and runs
them beside the pristine instructions in a freestanding Linux i386 process.
Only absolute constant addresses are relocated for that test. It exhausts
all **65,536 possible upper-16-bit outputs**, validates seed updates, and
compares both the rounded binary32 result and the returned x87 value:

| Precision | Before: binary32 differences | Before: x87 differences | After: either representation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| PC=11 (64 bits) | 512 | 65,535 | 0 |
| PC=10 (53 bits) | 512 | 65,535 | 0 |

Example: upper bits `257` produce `0x3b808081` with the old division, versus
the original's `0x3b808080`. This is a measured **numeric** difference, unlike
the earlier symbolic association finding. The neighboring `random_real_range`
already uses the correct reciprocal and its arithmetic was checked against
the original instructions.

Validation: native exhaustive comparison passes; VC71 is 100% instruction
match (16/16, operand score 87.5%); changed-file hazard scan is clean. This
proves the RNG value fix, **not yet its responsibility for the desync**.
All six diagnostic animation toggles were removed for the runtime test of
the reciprocal correction (XBE prefix `03dfe393601605d9`), and their live
redirects were verified. That build still desynced at tick **1705**, with
client/host seeds `416f5584`/`9867bb02`; the user reported **no grenades** in
this reproduction. The numeric fix is therefore also **not sufficient**.
Capture: `artifacts/rng_trace/rng_reciprocal_20260905_trace.json`, with no
continuity breaks. `kb.json` is unchanged.

### Paired traces and the partial-toggle ABI confound (September 6)

The normal client above was compared with a separately named host diagnostic:
original behavior except `random_math.obj` and the trace baseline's 15 retained
functions. The host diagnostic SHA-256 is
`a2a004b653cda20e795cfc2f06884921da0b463764b06ff297bf817a2caba59d`.
Idle play and then movement alone remained synchronized for several minutes.
The later reproduction disconnected at tick **18949**, seeds
`956ab6d3`/`e8460c39`. Both rings have no continuity breaks.

The first differing draw is earlier, at **18883**: client
`model_animation_choose_random` consumes seed `d67e8b5d`; the host consumes
that seed at **18886**. The client also draws at 18886 and 18889, leaving it
two draws ahead. Client probes identify unit `e4c70035`: after spawn-selection
draws at 18881, it changes animation state `0x15 -> 0` at 18882, then
`0 -> 2` at 18883. Thus disconnect time is delayed relative to the first
observed RNG divergence; it is not evidence of a fixed elapsed-time trigger.
The host capture lacks corresponding animation probes, so the earlier
unit-state divergence is still unlocalized.

Evidence: `artifacts/rng_trace/paired_original_20260905_{trace,host_trace}.json`,
`compare_pair.py paired_original_20260905`, and its comparison JSON.

The earlier immediate failures with original `unit_update_animation` have a
confirmed ABI confound. Original `FUN_001a86b0` preserves EDX. At `0x1b120c`,
the original caller calls this helper, then at `0x1b1215` pushes EDX as the
desired state without reloading it. The deployed reverse thunk at `0x9091aa`
and C implementation at `0x6eefd0` overwrite EDX. A machine-code comparison
over all 256 old-state bytes and 44 requested states finds identical AL
returns in all 11264 cases, but EDX differs in 11220. For old state 1 and
requested state 0, original EDX is 0 and candidate EDX is `ffffffff`.
Therefore toggling the original caller without also restoring this helper
is not a valid isolated comparison. This does **not** yet attribute the
normal-build desync to that helper; the compiled C caller keeps its requested
state separately. Evidence: `check_transition_liveout.py` and
`transition_liveout_evidence.json` in `artifacts/rng_trace`.

For the next paired capture, the host now has probes inserted directly around
the original main-animation update and desired-state transition calls.
The diagnostic preserves all registers and flags and performs no x87 work.
The stolen calls execute once with their original arguments. Eighteen
machine-code tests cover register/flag preservation, argument and unit-write
equivalence, state packing, and ring wrap. Both detours and original helpers
were verified in live host memory. Diagnostic SHA-256:
`fa079c608c6c350f2e0cb0b017b129f48dff7c24b8298d1fb9853fbfa8e72556`.
Scripts: `build_original_probes.py`, `test_original_probes.py`,
`verify_original_probes.py`. The host's original executable remains at
`E:\GAMES\halo-patched\cachebeta.xbe`; `host_diagnostic.py restore` relaunches
its recorded path. No `kb.json` toggles were changed.

Another build replaced the shared `build/halo` symbol file during capture.
The deployed symbols were recovered from the saved diagnostic XBE as
`artifacts/rng_trace/session_symbols.pe`; subsequent captures explicitly use
that file. Its function bodies include host deactivation stubs, so it is a
symbolization artifact, **not an unmodified compiler output for rebuilding**.

## Previously audited paths (not blanket exclusions)

Audited semantically against the pristine XBE (Capstone on
`halo-patched/cachebeta.xbe`; Ghidra MCP was intermittently down):

- Grenade/damage path, all clean: `object_find_in_radius`,
  `collision_bsp_test_vector`, `FUN_00148780`, `FUN_00148240`,
  `object_find_in_cluster`, `structure_find_in_cluster`,
  `object_cause_damage` (only diff: missing debug store to `0x46f070`),
  `FUN_00136f40`, `FUN_0009dcf0`, `FUN_00138e30`, `damage_data_new`,
  `FUN_0009d2d0`, `object_new`, `object_placement_data_new`,
  `unit_throw_grenade`, `FUN_000f9c40`, `FUN_000f7e40`, `FUN_000f8920`,
  `FUN_000f7e60`, `FUN_000f90d0`. Moot anyway: desync reproduces with no
  combat.
- `unit_animation_set_state` (0x1ad260; historical VC71 score corrected above): weapon-idle draw guard
  (`was_none || unit_map_animstate_to_idx(new) != unit_map_animstate_to_idx(old)`) matches the XBE;
  a 6 -> 0 transition must draw twice on both sides.
- `unit_update_animation` (0x1b0d90): clean vs XBE after byte-accuracy edits
  (dword `global_seat` load, signed `+0x256` switch, `anim_status_wide`).
- `FUN_001ab870` (0x1ab870) wrapper around the original
  `animation_update_internal`: probes show the frame counter (`state[1]`)
  and anim index (`state[0]`) going in, result coming out.

## Refuted: float addend association

**This section proposed a root cause that measurement later killed. Kept as a
record of a dead end, not as a finding.**

The refutation: reassociating a 3-term float dot product can only change the
result if the x87 is truncating intermediates to 24-bit single precision. At
53-bit or 64-bit it is exactly inert, because a float x float product needs only
48 mantissa bits and sums of three such products stay exact. Measured over
1,000,000 plausible inputs for `plane3d_distance_to_point`:

    intermediate precision   general-case   near-cancellation
      24-bit (PC=00)           31.075%          39.835%
      53-bit (PC=10)            0.000%           0.000%
      64-bit (PC=11)            0.000%           0.000%

Halo runs at 64-bit. Game code (0x11000-0x1d0000) contains **zero** `fldcw`
instructions; every one in the binary is in the CRT (`_controlfp`, and `_ftol`
setting rounding-control, not precision-control), and `fninit` at 0x1db4de
leaves the default 0x037F (PC=11, 64-bit extended). Nothing in the engine
narrows FPU precision, so addend order cannot produce a ULP difference.

`tools/audit/check_fpu_association.py` compares symbolic expression trees. It
proves a *structural* difference in how our clang binary accumulates, which is
necessary but **not** sufficient for an observable numeric difference. Treating
its output as a numeric result was the error here.

The original hypothesis follows, for the record.

## Superseded hypothesis: dot-product association

`FUN_00013070` (0x13070, the 3D dot product) accumulated its three terms in the
opposite order from the original.

Ours (as lifted):

    return a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1] + a[2] * b[2];   /* ((x + y) + z) */

The original at 0x13070:

    fld [eax+8]; fmul [ecx+8]    ; z
    fld [eax+4]; fmul [ecx+4]    ; y
    faddp st(1)                  ; (z + y)
    fld [eax];   fmul [ecx]      ; x
    faddp st(1)                  ; ((z + y) + x)

Floating-point addition is commutative but not associative, so `((x+y)+z)` and
`((z+y)+x)` differ by a ULP. `FUN_00013070` has 22 call sites and feeds AI
facing (`actions.c`, `actor_looking.c`), biped orientation (`bipeds.c`),
physics (`collision_usage.c`) and structure queries — so every 3D dot in the
engine was off by a ULP on our client and exact on the host.

That is enough to desync lockstep. The animation state byte comes from
`state_pair`, written by the **unported** originals `FUN_001a4c50` (turning) and
`FUN_001a5300` (moving). Those originals read our ported floats and compare them
against thresholds (`FUN_001a5300` at 0x1a5531 gates moving-vs-idle on the
throttle vector at `unit+0x228` being nonzero). A ULP flips such a threshold a
tick early or late, which moves an animation state change by a tick, which moves
the RNG draw by a tick. Symptom fit is exact: drift in both directions,
self-correcting, no combat needed, and reimpl-vs-reimpl stays in sync because
both sides are wrong the same way.

### Why every gate passed

VC71 scores `FUN_00013070` at 100.0% (14/14 insns, opnd 100.0%) both before and
after the fix. VC71 compiles our C with **cl.exe (MSVC 7.1)**, which reassociates
the expression back to the original's order. The binary we ship is built by
**clang**, which honours C's left-associativity. Any float-association
difference cl.exe normalises away is invisible to the byte-match lane by
construction. See `docs/lift-learnings.md` section 57.

Two-term reductions are safe (`a+b == b+a` is exact in IEEE); only chains of
three or more terms can diverge.

### Change applied anyway

    /* src/halo/math/vector_math.c */
    return a[2] * b[2] + a[1] * b[1] + a[0] * b[0];

Harmless and marginally more faithful to the original, but **not a fix for the
desync** -- see the refutation above. VC71 remains 100.0%.

`FUN_00012f60` (2D dot, 0x12f60) loads its terms in the other order too, but
with only two terms the result is bit-identical. Not a bug; left alone.

## Sweep: 16 more functions in the same class

`tools/audit/check_fpu_association.py` (new) symbolically executes the x87
stream of our clang objects and of the original XBE, builds an expression tree
for each, canonicalises the differences that carry no numeric content, and
reports the rest. Canonicalisation covers: commutative two-term nodes (`a+b ==
b+a` is exact), negation placement inside mul/div chains (`-(a/b) == (-a)/b`),
`.rdata` float literals versus `FLDZ`/`FLD1`, and a uniform parameter-index
shift. Register-to-parameter binding is flow-sensitive, because the original
reuses one register for two different parameters (e.g. "ECX switches from
param_1 to param_2" in `FUN_001057c0`). Anything outside pure-FPU straight-line
code is reported SKIP rather than guessed at.

Run: **736 compared, 31 mismatches across 16 functions** (plus `FUN_00013070`,
now fixed). Full report in `artifacts/fpu_assoc/sweep_20260905.txt`.

| function | object |
|----------|--------|
| `distance_squared3d` | `math/vector_math.c` |
| `FUN_0001ad60`, `FUN_0010a1c0` | `math/real_math.c` |
| `matrix_transform_point`, `matrix_transform_vector` | `math/real_math.c` |
| `real_matrix3x3_transform_vector`, `real_matrix4x3_transform_point` | `math/real_math.c` |
| `FUN_0010c340`, `FUN_0010c8e0` | `math/random_math.c` |
| `FUN_001057f0` | `structures/structures.c` |
| `FUN_00193b80` | `structures/structure_detail_objects.c` |
| `FUN_0018d670` | `scenario/scenario.c` |
| `midpoint3d` | `ai/actor_moving.c` |
| `plane3d_distance_to_point`, `triple_product3d` | `effects/decals.c` |
| `real_rgb_color_brightness` | `bitmaps/bitmap_utilities.c` |

Every one is the same shape as `FUN_00013070`: our clang code accumulates
`((x+y)+z)` where the original accumulates `((z+y)+x)`. None of them are fixed
yet — see "Confirming the fix" for why.

## Superseded hypothesis

Some **ported state writer upstream of the animation update** produces the
unit's animation state byte (`unit+0x253`), movement byte (`unit+0x256`), or
frame timing input one tick off from the original. Candidates, in order:

1. `unit_update_animation` (0x1b0d90) or the callee chain under it
   (`unit_animation_set_state`, `FUN_001ab870`).
2. The `state_pair` writers in the biped update `biped_update_dispatcher` (0x1a6350,
   89.9%): `FUN_001a4c50` (turning), `FUN_001a5300` (moving),
   `biped_death_handler` (dying, 86.4%), `FUN_001a2900`, `FUN_001a2a60`.
3. The dead flag at `unit+0xb6` bit 2/4 and other `unit_update_animation`
   callers (`0x1b300a`, `0x1b9735`).

## Toggle-bisect: abandoned

`ported: false` is per-function, so deactivating `unit_update_animation`
(0x1b0d90) leaves its separately-ported callees (`unit_animation_set_state`,
`FUN_001ab870`, `unit_set_animation`, `model_animation_choose_random`) still
redirected to our C. "Desync persists therefore the callees are ruled out" would
have been an invalid inference. The experiment was dropped once the dot-product
divergence was found; the diagnostic `ported: false` has been reverted.

## Confirming the fix

The remaining step is an in-game repro: rebuild, deploy to 10.0.0.21, and run a
system-link match against the pristine host on 10.0.0.24 using the procedure
below.

- (Obsolete: the float-association theory is refuted; the repro below no longer
  tests anything about it.)
- Desync gone: `FUN_00013070` was the cause; work through the sweep list next.
- Desync persists: `FUN_00013070` was a real but separate latent bug; resume from
  the trace evidence, starting with `distance_squared3d` and
  `plane3d_distance_to_point`, which are on the same movement path.

Fix exactly one thing before the repro. The other 15 are deliberately left
unfixed: changing 16 reduction orders at once makes a negative result
un-attributable.

Authoritative build path for the deploy is `/mnt/g/dev/halo/build`. A concurrent
build in the `/mnt/g/dev/halo-bugs` worktree runs on this box; do not deploy
from it.

## Procedure (bridged xemu from WSL)

Guests are reachable from Linux only; Windows Python times out
(`WinError 10060`).

    # build (about 5 min) and push to the patched client through WSL-native XBDM
    rtk ./tools/xbox/build_deploy_run.sh --xemu-bridged --xbox 10.0.0.21 -- -q --rng-trace
    # after reproduction, while still in game (ring is lost on return to dashboard)
    HALO_WINDOWS_REEXEC=1 python3 tools/xbox/rng_trace_dump.py --host 10.0.0.21 --out artifacts/rng_trace/aN.json
    python3 tools/xbox/rng_trace_dump.py --probes artifacts/rng_trace/aN.json
    HALO_WINDOWS_REEXEC=1 python3 tools/xbox/xbdm_debug_txt.py --host 10.0.0.21 --lines 200 --output artifacts/rng_trace/debug_client_aN.txt --timeout 30
    HALO_WINDOWS_REEXEC=1 python3 tools/xbox/xbdm_debug_txt.py --host 10.0.0.24 --lines 200 --output artifacts/rng_trace/debug_host_aN.txt --timeout 30

The build-and-push command trips the skill-router gate once; rerun it unchanged.
`debug.txt` on both boxes carries the `out of sync` line with the tick and
both seeds; correlate its tick with the trace records.

## Uncommitted work tied to this investigation

- Probes: `src/halo/math/rng_trace.h` kinds 15-18; `units.c`
  (`unit_animation_set_state` kind 16, `FUN_001ab870` kinds 17/18);
  decoder in `tools/xbox/rng_trace_dump.py`. All under `#ifdef HALO_RNG_TRACE`
  with `#line` restores.
- Byte-accuracy edits in `units.c` (`unit_animation_state_allows_impulse`,
  `unit_update_running_blind`, `unit_update_animation`, `unit_select_movement_on_state`) and
  `damage.c` (`object_cause_damage`).
- `kb.json`: 0x120670 decl `build_damage_animation_index`; diagnostic
  `ported=false` on 0x1b0d90.
- `tools/xbox/deploy_xbox.py`: `HALO_NATIVE_XBDM=1` uses Linux Python for
  XBDM upload.

## Latent issues found along the way (not the desync)

- `0x9dcf0` missing `@eax/@edx/@ecx/@esi` annotations.
- `FUN_000f7e60` missing `@esi/@edi/@eax/@edx/@ecx`.
- `FUN_00148eb0` param_3 declared int, is float.
- `object_cause_damage` lacks the original's debug store to `0x46f070`.
- Sub-90% VC71 on the path: `unit_animation_set_state` 87.3 after the audit above,
  `FUN_000f7e60` 72.2, `FUN_000f9c40` 89.1, `biped_update_dispatcher` 89.9,
  `biped_death_handler` 86.4.

## Paired capture 2026-09-06 (shoot-only): divergence localized

First paired capture with animation probes live on BOTH sides. Client
`10.0.0.21` ran the traced build (rev `25e26a513`, `RNGT` ring present); host
`10.0.0.24` ran `rng_probe.xbe` (SHA `fa079c60...`, detours re-verified in live
memory after a CI incident). Artifacts:
`artifacts/rng_trace/shoot_only_20260906{,_host}.json`,
`shoot_only_20260906_host.bin` (raw ring), and
`debug_{client,host}_shoot_only.txt`.

Desync reported by the client at update #1121
(`#5e9321ab`/`#8719cf51`); the host declared client machine #1 out of sync at
game tick #1249.

### Alignment

Both sides reseed to `000040b2` at the match start (host ring index 119496,
client 119262). Frame numbering is IDENTICAL on the two sides -- an assumed
one-tick offset scores 41.9% agreement on `anim_update_in` values versus 87.3%
at offset 0, so offset 0 is the alignment. Do not assume a tick skew.

### First divergence

1217 consecutive seed-consuming draws match exactly. Draw ordinal 1218, with
seed `cc6b2274` still identical on both sides:

    HOST    tick 996  random_direction3d   caller 0x1aba66
    CLIENT  tick 995  random_math_real     caller model_animation_choose_random+78

The client consumes a draw the original never consumes. Its cause is one frame
earlier, on unit handle `0xe3170037`, at the state-request site
(`unit_update_animation+862`, original `0x1b1215`, which IS instrumented on both
sides):

    frame 993   anim_state=0x15 old=0xff    host YES   client YES
    frame 994   anim_state=0x00 old=0x15    host YES   client YES
    frame 995   anim_state=0x03 old=0x00    host NO    client YES  <-- extra

The extra transition calls `unit_animation_set_state+779`, which calls
`model_animation_choose_random`, which draws. From frame 996 the unit's state
byte is `0xbd` on the client versus `0xa8` on the host and never reconverges.

### What is NOT the cause

- **Not an extra animation-update call.** Site-matched (client `+484` only,
  the site corresponding to the host's sole `anim_update_in` probe at
  `0x1b0f58`), call counts are (1,1) on all 7757 comparable frames.
  An earlier "client calls 2-3x, host never double-calls" reading was an
  INSTRUMENTATION ARTIFACT: `unit_update_animation` has FOUR call sites to
  `FUN_001ab870` (+413, +456, +997, +1071) and only +456 carries a host probe,
  while our build probes four sites (+436, +484, +682, +765). Any future
  cross-side count comparison must filter to the site the host actually probes.
- **Not `state[1]`.** The second half of the pair is a frame counter that
  increments in lockstep on both sides.

### The remaining question

At `0x1b11f9` the original loads the CURRENT state into CX and takes either of
two skips before transitioning:

    001b1201  cmp   dx, cx
    001b1204  je    0x1b121f        ; skip 1: desired == current
    001b120c  call  0x1a86b0        ; gate; preserves EDX
    001b1211  test  al, al
    001b1213  je    0x1b121f        ; skip 2: gate returned 0
    001b1215  push  edx             ; EDX reused WITHOUT reload
    001b1217  call  0x1ad260        ; unit_animation_set_state

Current state was `0x00` and our desired state was `0x03`, so skip 1 cannot
have fired for us. Either the original's desired state (EDX) was `0x00` at that
moment and it took skip 1, or its gate `FUN_001a86b0` returned 0 and it took
skip 2. Distinguishing these two is the next step, and it decides the fix:

- If EDX differed, the bug is UPSTREAM in whatever computes the desired state.
- If the gate differed, the bug is in `FUN_001a86b0` -- note its AL return was
  previously verified identical across all 11264 (old_state, requested_state)
  machine-code cases, but it takes a POINTER (`lea ecx,[edi+0x248]`) and reads
  `[ecx+0xb]`, so its result depends on struct contents that sweep did not vary.

A third probe recording EDX and the gate's AL at `0x1b1211` on both sides would
settle it in one capture.

## Static resolution of the frame-995 fork (2026-09-06, no new capture)

The previous section ended by proposing a third probe on EDX and the gate's AL
at `0x1b1211`. That capture is NOT needed: both branches of the fork resolve
statically, and one of them also closes an instrumentation gap that would have
invalidated the whole section.

### Instrumentation gap check (this had to pass first)

The `FUN_001ab870` episode taught that a single host probe on a multi-site
callee manufactures fake findings. So before trusting "host took no transition
at frame 995", count the call sites to the transition callee:

    call 0x1ad260 (unit_animation_set_state) inside unit_update_animation
      0x1b1217  (+1159)   <-- the probed site (host patch at 0x1b1215)
      TOTAL: 1 site

One site, and it is the probed one. The claim holds: the host really did not
transition at frame 995.

### The gate `FUN_001a86b0` is exonerated analytically

Its entire input domain is two values -- `byte [ecx+0xb]` and DX:

    001a86b0  movsx ecx, byte ptr [ecx + 0xb]
    001a86b4  add   ecx, -2
    001a86b7  cmp   ecx, 0x27
    001a86ba  mov   al, 1
    001a86bc  ja    0x1a86ec          ; -> ret with AL=1
    001a86be  movzx ecx, byte ptr [ecx + 0x1a8704]
    001a86c5  jmp   dword ptr [ecx*4 + 0x1a86f0]

All five jump-table arms (`0x1a86cc/d5/e5/ea/ec`) read only DX. Nothing else is
loaded, so the earlier 11264-case (old_state, requested_state) sweep WAS
exhaustive -- the doc's earlier note that "struct contents the sweep did not
vary" could matter is wrong, and is corrected here.

Stronger still, for this exact frame: the caller does
`lea ecx,[edi+0x248]`, so `[ecx+0xb]` is `[edi+0x253]` -- the *same* current-state
byte the caller loads into CX. Current state was 0x00, so `ecx = 0 - 2 =
0xFFFFFFFE`, which is `ja 0x27`, so the gate returns **AL=1 unconditionally**.
Skip 2 cannot have fired on either side.

### There is a THIRD path to the call, not two

    001b11ee  mov   al, byte ptr [ebp - 1]
    001b11f1  test  al, al
    001b11f3  mov   edx, dword ptr [ebp - 0xc]
    001b11f7  jne   0x1b1215            ; force: bypasses BOTH skips
    001b11f9  movsx cx, byte ptr [edi + 0x253]
    001b1201  cmp   dx, cx
    001b1204  je    0x1b121f            ; skip 1
    001b1206  lea   ecx, [edi + 0x248]
    001b120c  call  0x1a86b0
    001b1211  test  al, al
    001b1213  je    0x1b121f            ; skip 2 (proven inert here)
    001b1215  push  edx
    001b1216  push  esi
    001b1217  call  0x1ad260

`[ebp-1]` is a force flag, set at `0x1b115a` when `FUN_001a8790` returns 0.
With skip 2 inert, the host not transitioning means the host had force==0 AND
desired state == current state == 0. Ours pushed 3.

### The desired state is an input PARAMETER, so the bug is in the caller

`[ebp-0xc]` has exactly two writes in the whole function:

    001b0dcd (+61)   mov dword ptr [ebp - 0xc], eax    ; eax = movsx ax, byte [ebp+0xc]
    001b0fe3 (+595)  mov dword ptr [ebp - 0xc], 0x28

`[ebp+0xc]` is param_2. So `unit_update_animation(unit_handle, char *anim_state)`
does not compute the desired state -- it receives it, and 0x28 != 3, so ours came
straight from `*param_2`. Nothing inside this function is at fault.

(Note for whoever edits this: at `0x1b0db8` the load is `movsx ax, ...`, a 16-bit
movsx that writes only AX, so the dword stored at `[ebp-0xc]` carries a stale
upper half from the preceding `tag_get` return. Harmless here because every
consumer uses DX, but do not "clean it up" into a 32-bit movsx.)

### Caller narrowed to three ported functions

`unit_update_animation` has no direct `call` site in the image; ours is
`src/halo/units/units.c:1186`, passing `state_pair`, initialized to 0 and then
filled by five callees (`units.c:1119-1138`):

    FUN_001a4c50   ported: null   <- runs ORIGINAL code, cannot diverge
    FUN_001a5300   ported: null   <- runs ORIGINAL code, cannot diverge
    FUN_001a2900   ported: true       writes 0x28 / 0x14
    FUN_001a2a60   ported: true       writes 0x15 / 0x16
    biped_death_handler   ported: true       writes 0x18 / 0x19

No ported code anywhere in `src/` writes 3 into that byte (`rg '\*state(_out)? = 3'`
is empty; the only state writes in bipeds.c/units.c are the six values above).

So the value 3 is written by original code, and our divergence is that original
code *chose* to write it -- i.e. some input it reads differed, or a ported callee
it dispatches to returned differently. `FUN_001a5300` and `FUN_001a4c50` are
step dispatchers that call ported step functions (`FUN_001a2b90`'s header
comment names `FUN_001a5300` as its dispatcher), so a ported step corrupting
biped state upstream is the live hypothesis.

Next step is therefore NOT another probe on `0x1b1211` -- it is to find which
store in `FUN_001a4c50` / `FUN_001a5300` writes 3, and which ported callee feeds
its predicate.

### Negative result worth recording

The captured client build INCLUDED the `FUN_0010a5e0` x87-narrowing fix, and the
desync still reproduced with the same `model_animation_choose_random` signature.
That closes the x87-narrowing lane as a cause of this desync. The fix remains a
genuine correctness fix (see docs/lift-learnings.md and
tools/audit/check_x87_narrowing.py); it is simply not this bug.

## The fork is a float comparison (2026-09-06, same session)

The section above ended by saying the next step was to find which store in
`FUN_001a4c50` / `FUN_001a5300` writes state 3. It is `FUN_001a4c50` at
`0x1a5183`, and the answer changes the shape of the investigation.

### The writer

Neither dispatcher stores a literal 3; both write the state byte through a
register. In `FUN_001a4c50`:

    001a5160  fld   dword ptr [eax + 0x4c8]   ; per-tag threshold
    001a5166  fld   dword ptr [ebp - 0xc]     ; computed value
    001a5169  fcomp st(1)
    001a516b  fnstsw ax
    001a516f  test  ah, 5
    001a5172  jp    0x1a5193                  ; skip the write entirely
    ...
    001a5183  mov   cl, byte ptr [ebp - 1]
    001a5186  mov   eax, dword ptr [ebp + 0xc]
    001a5189  test  cl, cl
    001a518b  setne dl
    001a518e  add   dl, 2                     ; dl = 2 or 3
    001a5191  mov   byte ptr [eax], dl        ; <-- the desired state

So the state is 2 or 3 depending on the `[ebp-1]` flag, and it is written at
all only on one side of an x87 compare. `2` and `3` are the two turn-in-place
directions.

### What the compared value is

From the aligned disassembly at `0x1a5061` (a jump target, so a safe boundary
-- disassembling from an arbitrary address here decodes garbage and invents
operands, which cost one wrong reading before this):

    001a5061  lea   eax, [esi + 0x1d4]        ; desired facing
    ...       copy to [ebp-0x20..], force z = 0
    001a5083  call  0x12f10                   ; magnitude
    001a5088  fcomp dword ptr [0x2533c0]      ; degenerate? then fall back to
    001a5098  lea   edx, [esi + 0x24]         ;   the current facing
    ...
    001a50ac  fld   dword ptr [ebp - 0x20]    ; cross_z = a.x*b.y - a.y*b.x
    001a50b2  fmul  dword ptr [edi + 4]       ;   -> sign selects [ebp-1],
    001a50ba  fsubp st(1)                     ;      i.e. which way to turn
    001a50bc  fld   dword ptr [ebp - 0x1c]    ; dot = a.x*b.x + a.y*b.y
    001a50cb  faddp st(1)
    001a50cd  fstp  dword ptr [ebp - 0xc]     ; <-- the compared value

`[ebp-0xc]` is the **cosine of the angle between the biped's desired facing
(`+0x1d4`) and its current facing (`+0x24`)**, and `[ebp-1]` is the sign of
their cross product. The fork at `0x1a5172` is therefore "is the biped turned
far enough from where it wants to face to play a turn-in-place animation", and
our biped answered yes where the original answered no.

**Struck 2026-09-06.** This paragraph previously claimed the same signature as
"the open a10 report of a biped that rotates without translating". That report
is not open -- it was fixed long ago -- so the cross-reference was wrong and
carried no evidence either way. Nothing else in this document depends on it.

### This REOPENS the float-precision lane

The previous section recorded, correctly, that the captured build already had
the `FUN_0010a5e0` x87-narrowing fix and still desynced. That remains true, but
the conclusion drawn from it -- "closes the x87-narrowing lane as a cause" -- was
too strong and is **withdrawn here**. It only rules out that one function. The
fork is decided by a single `fcomp` of a computed cosine against a threshold, so
a sub-ULP difference in the facing vectors flips it. Float precision upstream is
now the PRIME suspect, not a closed lane.

### Where it is not

Checked and clean (not flagged by tools/audit/check_x87_narrowing.py):
`normalize3d`, `magnitude3d`, the dot/cross helpers, and `unit_update_aim_constraints` (the
ported aiming-vector update called from inside `FUN_001a4c50` itself). Our
ported normalization of `+0x1d4` (`src/halo/units/units.c:1058-1065`) is a
faithful in-place normalize with the z component zeroed and a world-forward
fallback.

### Where to look next

The full detector run is 5891 functions compared, 207 flagged (the earlier
"397 compared, 29 flagged" figure was a partial run; use the 207). Ranked
candidates that feed biped facing, worst first:

    actor_move_compute_avoidance            src/halo/ai/actor_moving.c   ours 4,  xbe 15  (-11)
    FUN_001a2f40            src/halo/units/bipeds.c      ours 14, xbe 21  (-7)
    actor_destination_update src/halo/ai/actor_moving.c  ours 0,  xbe 4   (-4)
    actor_move_avoidance_ray_cast            src/halo/ai/actor_moving.c   ours 0,  xbe 4   (-4)
    FUN_001a2160            src/halo/units/bipeds.c      ours 1,  xbe 3   (-2)
    biped_collision_direction            src/halo/units/bipeds.c      ours 1,  xbe 3   (-2)
    actor_move_update       src/halo/ai/actor_moving.c   ours 3,  xbe 4   (-1)

`FUN_001a2f40` is notable because the unported dispatcher `FUN_001a5300` calls
it directly on the same tick, and it is the worst offender in the units/bipeds
group.

Note the whole chain runs through UNPORTED code (`FUN_001a4c50`,
`FUN_001a5300`), so the bug cannot be in the decision logic itself -- only in
the float inputs that ported code hands it. That is what makes the narrowing
detector the right instrument here rather than another capture.

## Candidate list corrected by intersection with the fork's inputs (2026-09-06)

The previous section ranked x87-narrowing candidates by raw delta. That was the
wrong instrument: a narrowing delta only matters if the function touches one of
the two vectors the `fcomp` at `0x1a5183` actually compares — the biped's
desired facing (`+0x1d4`) and its current facing (`+0x24`). Intersecting the
flagged set with the writers and readers of those two vectors reorders it and
drops one entry entirely.

| function | delta | touches the fork's inputs? | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actor_move_compute_avoidance` (`actor_moving.c`) | -11 | reads `obj+0x24`, and its callers at `actor_moving.c:3717` take its `slerp`/`weight` outputs into the desired-facing path | **top candidate** |
| `FUN_001a2160` (`bipeds.c`) | -2 | it *is* the per-tick writer of current facing `+0x24` | second, but see below |
| `FUN_001a2f40` (`bipeds.c`) | -7 | 956 lines, no access to `+0x1d4`, `+0x24`, `+0x28`, `+0x2c` or `+0x30` anywhere in its body | **drop — noise for this bug** |

### `FUN_001a2160` site-level result

Per-site comparison (not just counts) narrows what its -2 means. The XBE
narrows three cross-product temporaries at `ebp-0x20/-0x1c/-0x18`
(`fstp dword` then `fld dword`, `0x1a21ef`..`0x1a2236`); our build keeps two of
the three live in ST at 64-bit. Those temporaries feed **only the up vector**
(`unit+0x30`). They reach the forward vector — the one the fork compares —
through exactly one edge: the degenerate test at `0x1a2248`,

    call 0x13010            ; normalize3d(up_ptr)
    fcomp dword ptr [0x2533c0]
    test  ah, 0x44
    jp    0x1a2283          ; skip the reset
    ...                     ; else fwd(+0x24) = global forward, up = global up

so a precision difference here only propagates when the rebuilt up vector is
near-degenerate. Real coupling, narrow band.

`cos_a`/`sin_a` are **not** a divergence here even though clang stores them as
`fstp tbyte [ebp-0x24]` / `[ebp-0x3c]`. Both are reloaded and narrowed with
`fstp dword ptr [esp+0xc]` / `[esp+0x8]` at the call boundary, so each value is
rounded to float32 exactly once, the same as the XBE's `fstp dword [ebp-8]`
straight after `fcos`. An 80-bit spill is only a finding when nothing narrows
the value before it is consumed.

### Two checks that must come before any more candidate grinding

The "it is an `fcomp`, therefore precision" step skips two questions, and two of
the three possible answers make the narrowing list the wrong tool entirely:

1. **Did the original even reach `0x1a5160`?** `FUN_001a4c50` has earlier
   integer exits — `je 0x1a52f9` at `0x1a4f65` when `[esi+0x257] == 0`, and the
   `and eax,0x40 / je 0x1a5061` split at `0x1a4f73`. If the host bailed before
   the compare, the divergence is in an integer or flag upstream and no float
   work touches it.
2. **How far apart were the cosine and the threshold?** A sub-ULP difference
   flips a compare *only when the operands are within an ULP of each other*.
   If `|cos - threshold|` is appreciable, the desired-facing vector is
   substantively wrong and this is a logic bug, not a precision one.

One probe at `0x1a5169` recording (reached-flag, ST0, ST1, unit handle)
discriminates all three outcomes in a single capture. Census its call sites
first, the same way `0x1ad260` was censused above.

Because of this, the earlier sentence "a sub-ULP difference in either facing
vector flips it" should be read as **only when the two operands are near-equal**.

### Tooling note

Do not name a scratch analysis script `/tmp/dis.py`. Python's `inspect` imports
the stdlib `dis` module, so a shadowing script in the CWD produces a confusing
circular-import traceback (and breaks `apport`'s excepthook) even though the
script's own output is correct.

## Paired capture 2026-09-06 (repro B): the divergence is TWO records

Second reproduction, both guests instrumented (client `10.0.0.21` trace build,
host `10.0.0.24` running `host_rng_probe.xbe`, ring at `0x7ff900` — dump it
with `--pe artifacts/rng_trace/session_symbols.pe`, the default cachebeta
symbol lookup finds the wrong VA and reports a magic mismatch).

Client ticks 0..6763, host 425..6847, first `out of sync` at tick **6635**.
Diffing every `probe:unit_state` record by (tick, unit, state) over the whole
overlap gives exactly two client-only records and **zero** host-only:

    t=6627  handle=0xe3c20037  new=3  old=0
    t=6633  handle=0xe3c20037  new=0  old=3

Everything else in ~6,800 ticks matches. The unit enters animation state 3 on
our build, sits there six ticks, and leaves; the original never enters it. The
exit at 6633 draws from the global seed via `model_animation_choose_random`
(three draws at t=6633/6634), and the seeds mismatch two ticks later. That
closes the mechanism: **an animation transition is a seed draw, so one extra
transition is one extra draw.**

### The recorded state value was always in the capture

`probe:unit_state` has no `value` field; the packed `(new<<8)|old` state is
carried in **`seed_before`**. Reading `r.get("value", 0)` yields a histogram of
all zeros and looks like "the probe records no state". It does. This also
retroactively confirms the earlier *inference* that the spurious state is 3 —
it is now measured, not deduced from `setne dl; add dl,2`.

### Corrections to the previous section

- Ranking client-only transitions without the paired host capture suggested a
  burst at 6625/6626/6627 and therefore a gross, repeating error. Wrong: 6625
  and 6626 occur on **both** sides. Only 6627 and 6633 are ours alone.
- One transient excursion in 6,800 ticks that self-corrects after six ticks is
  the knife-edge signature, not the gross-error one. The precision hypothesis
  is back in first place, and `actor_move_compute_avoidance` / `FUN_001a2160` are live again.

### The fork has three gates, only one of which is float

    0x1a5142  eax = [esi+0x1b8]
    0x1a5148  test ah,1   / jne 0x1a52f9        ; gate 1 — integer flag, exits
    0x1a5151  test al,0x20 / je  0x1a515d       ; threshold select
    0x1a5155    fld dword [0x28ace8]            ;   A: constant
    0x1a515d    fld dword [eax+0x4c8]           ;   B: from tag data
    0x1a5166  fld dword [ebp-0xc]               ; the facing cosine
    0x1a5169  fcomp st(1)                       ; gate 2 — FLOAT
    0x1a516f  test ah,5   / jp  0x1a5193        ;   skip if not below
    0x1a5177  test [ecx+0x17c], 0x100000
    0x1a5181  jne 0x1a5193                      ; gate 3 — integer flag
    0x1a5183  setne dl; add dl,2 -> state 2 or 3

`setne`/`add dl,2` can only produce 2 or 3, never 0. The host wrote no
transition at all, so the original did not reach `0x1a5183` — it failed gate 1,
2 or 3. Gates 1 and 3 are integer flag tests; a wrong flag bit would normally
diverge persistently rather than for six ticks, which is why gate 2 (the
`fcomp`) remains the leading candidate. But gates 1 and 3 are now explicit
alternatives that must be ruled out rather than assumed away.

Next probe, if one is needed, should record at `0x1a5169`: the two `fcomp`
operands, plus `[esi+0x1b8]` and `[ecx+0x17c]`, which distinguishes all three
gates in one capture. Note the host probe framework already supports a value
payload — `log(at, kind, value_code, caller)` in
`artifacts/rng_trace/build_original_probes.py`.

## Causality proven: the seed streams are one stream, shifted two draws (2026-09-06)

The previous section established a *temporal* correlation -- two client-only
animation transitions at ticks 6627 and 6633, first `out of sync` at 6635 --
and inferred causality from the mechanism (a transition calls
`model_animation_choose_random`, which draws). That inference is now a
measurement.

Diffing the seed-consuming draws in the paired repro-B capture, keyed by tick:

    385 of 385 shared draw ticks (591..6633) agree on seed_before exactly
    first divergent seed value:  tick 6634
    client-only draw ticks:      6627, 6633, 6751
    host-only draw ticks:        6685

The raw sequence around the excursion shows what actually happened. These are
the same seed values on both sides, consumed at different ticks:

    tick   CLIENT                          HOST
    6626   2615001737                      2615001737
    6627   2174052948   <- extra draw      (no draw)
    6633   3147223459   <- extra draw      (no draw)
    6634   1401522854                      2174052948
    6634   3521061325                      3147223459
    6642    423647432                      1401522854

Both machines walk the identical LCG sequence. The client simply reaches each
value two draws earlier, because it burned two extra draws -- one entering the
animation state at 6627, one leaving it at 6633 -- and those are exactly the two
client-only `probe:unit_state` records. This is not "a different random
stream"; it is the same stream, phase-shifted by two.

It also answers a loose end: the state *entry* at 6627 does consume a draw
immediately. The mismatch is not logged until 6635 only because the next draw
the host performs after 6626 is at 6634.

`seed_before` carrying the packed state is likewise no longer an inference:
`tools/xbox/rng_trace_dump.py` documents kind 16 as
`seed_before = (anim_state << 8) | old_state`.

### Gate 3 and the threshold are read-only tag data -- eliminated

`FUN_001a4c50`'s prologue resolves what `[ebp-8]` is:

    0x1a4c69  push 0x62697064        ; 'bipd'
    0x1a4c6e  call 0x1ba140          ; tag_get(group, index)
    0x1a4c73  mov  edx, eax
    0x1a4c81  mov  dword ptr [ebp-8], edx

`[ebp-8]` is the **biped tag definition pointer** -- map content, byte-identical
on both machines, written once at once at load. There is exactly one write to
the slot in the whole function. Therefore:

- Gate 3, `test dword ptr [ecx+0x17c], 0x100000` with `ecx = [ebp-8]`, **cannot
  differ between the two machines. Eliminated.**
- The gate-2 threshold, `fld dword ptr [eax+0x4c8]` with `eax = [ebp-8]`, is
  also identical. So is the alternative `fld dword ptr [0x28ace8]`, a constant.
  Only the *other* `fcomp` operand -- the facing cosine at `[ebp-0xc]`, which
  ported code computes -- can differ.
- `test bl,1` at `0x1a5117` reads `[edx+0x2f4]`, tag flags from the same
  pointer. Also identical, also eliminated.

### The gate list was incomplete -- corrected from a clean boundary

Disassembling from the jump target `0x1a5061` (starting at `0x1a5130` decoded
mid-instruction and invented operands -- the same trap recorded earlier in this
document) shows more runtime gates than previously published:

    0x1a5109  al = [esi+0x42a];  cmp al,1;  je  0x1a51aa      RUNTIME
    0x1a5117  test bl,1          -> 0x1a51aa                  tag, eliminated
    0x1a5120  test al,al         -> exit 0x1a52f9             RUNTIME (+0x42a)
    0x1a5128  al = [ebp-2];      test al,al -> exit           RUNTIME (local)
    0x1a5133  eax = [esi+0x1b4]; test ah,0x40 -> exit         RUNTIME
    0x1a5142  eax = [esi+0x1b8]; test ah,1    -> exit         RUNTIME
    0x1a5151  test al,0x20       threshold select             (both operands tag)
    0x1a5169  fcomp st(1)  + test ah,5 + jp                   FLOAT
    0x1a5177  test [ecx+0x17c],0x100000                       tag, eliminated
    0x1a5183  setne dl; add dl,2 -> writes state 2 or 3

`esi` is the unit object. The surviving runtime integer gates are `+0x42a`,
`+0x1b4` bit 0x4000, `+0x1b8` bit 0x100, and the local `[ebp-2]`.

### The immediate caller is ported and writes one of the gates

`biped_update_dispatcher` (`src/halo/units/units.c`) is the per-tick biped dispatcher and
the direct caller of `FUN_001a4c50`. It is ported, and in the same block it

- normalizes the desired-facing vector at `+0x1d4` (`units.c:1053-1063`) -- one
  of the two vectors whose cosine gate 2 compares, and
- writes `+0x42a` from the animation state at `+0x253` (`units.c:1068-1083`) --
  a surviving runtime gate.

The x87-narrowing detector does **not** flag `biped_update_dispatcher`, nor `normalize3d`.
Of the fork's upstream chain only two functions are flagged:

    actor_move_compute_avoidance  src/halo/ai/actor_moving.c   ours  4, xbe 15  (-11)
    FUN_001a2160  src/halo/units/bipeds.c      ours  1, xbe  3   (-2)

which is the ranking already recorded above, now with the caller ruled out.

### Detector fix: unported thunks were 30% of the findings

`check_x87_narrowing.py` was comparing `unported_thunks.c` entries -- JMP-only
stubs containing no FPU code at all -- against real XBE functions, so every
unported function scored "ours 0" and sorted to the top. 63 of the 207 reported
findings were this artifact. With `unported_thunks.c.obj` skipped the run is
**5375 compared, 144 MISSING-NARROWING**. Quote 144, not 207.

### The `+0x42a` gates are eliminated too -- by measurement plus a table check

`+0x42a` is written *only* by the ported `biped_update_dispatcher` switch, as a pure
function of the animation state at `+0x253`. Two independent facts close it.

**The switch is correct.** The XBE compiles it as a jump table:

    0x1a64b8  movsx eax, byte ptr [esi+0x253]
    0x1a64bf  cmp   eax, 7
    0x1a64c2  ja    0x1a64e4                 ; unsigned -- negatives take default
    0x1a64c4  movzx ecx, byte ptr [eax + 0x1a67a4]
    0x1a64cb  jmp   dword ptr [ecx*4 + 0x1a6798]

    index table @0x1a67a4 : [0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    jump targets @0x1a6798: 0x1a64db -> +0x42a = 0
                            0x1a64d2 -> +0x42a = 1
                            0x1a64e4 -> +0x42a = 2  (also the `ja` default)

So the original maps `0,2,3 -> 0`, `4..7 -> 1`, `1 and everything else -> 2`.
Our C (`units.c:1068-1083`) is `case 0,2,3 -> 0`, `case 4,5,6,7 -> 1`,
`default -> 2`, with `anim_state` declared `signed char`. State 1 falls to our
`default` and to their index-2 arm, both giving 2. **Identical, including the
negative-state case.** No bug here.

**`+0x253` was identical at 6627.** The kind-16 probe payload decodes as

    0f b7 c2                movzx eax, dx                 ; new state
    c1 e0 08                shl   eax, 8
    0f b6 8f 53 02 00 00    movzx ecx, byte ptr [edi+0x253]   ; OLD state
    09 c8                   or    eax, ecx

so the low byte of `seed_before` is `+0x253` read live at each call. Comparing
the full `(tick, unit, new, old)` tuple across the paired capture: 171 client
records, 169 host, **zero host-only**, and the two client-only records are the
excursion itself. For the excursion unit `0xe3c20037`:

    CLIENT  (6625, 21<-255)  (6626, 0<-21)  (6627, 3<-0)  (6633, 0<-3)
    HOST    (6625, 21<-255)  (6626, 0<-21)

Both machines set `+0x253 = 0` at tick 6626 and neither writes it again before
6627. State 0 maps to `+0x42a = 0` on both. Therefore at the fork:

    0x1a5109  cmp al,1   -> not taken on either machine
    0x1a5120  test al,al -> not taken on either machine

**Both `+0x42a` gates passed identically. Eliminated.**

### `[ebp-2]` traced

    0x1a4f59  al = [esi+0x257]
    0x1a4f5f  test al,al
    0x1a4f61  [ebp-2] = 0
    0x1a4f65  je 0x1a52f9        ; +0x257 == 0 -> exit
    0x1a4f6b  cmp al,5
    0x1a4f6f  [ebp-2] = 1        ; only when +0x257 == 5

`[ebp-2]` is not independent state: it is `(+0x257 == 5)`.

### Where that leaves the fork

Eliminated: gate 3, the gate-2 threshold, `test bl,1` (all tag data); both
`+0x42a` gates (measured identical). Still unaccounted for, all runtime unit
fields nobody has captured:

    +0x257                (via [ebp-2], and the 0x1a4f65 early exit)
    +0x1b4 bit 0x4000
    +0x1b8 bit 0x100
    the fcomp at 0x1a5169 -- facing cosine vs tag threshold

The float gate is now the *largest* surviving candidate rather than the only
one, and it is the only one whose input ported code computes through the FPU.

**Probe placement, corrected:** a probe at `0x1a5169` only fires if the original
reaches it, so on the host it would record nothing and name no gate. Probe the
top of the chain at `0x1a5109` instead, logging `+0x42a`, `+0x257`, `+0x1b4`,
`+0x1b8` in one payload -- it fires unconditionally on both machines and the
diff names the gate directly. A second probe at `0x1a5169` then supplies the
two `fcomp` operands when the chain is reached.

### Scope of the seed-stream proof

The wide tick-keyed comparison was `385 / 397` agreeing, where the 12
disagreements are all at ticks >= 6634 and the comparison used only the *first*
draw of each tick. The one-for-one value alignment above comes from the
6600-6645 zoom, which covers the high-volume ticks in full. The whole proof is
scoped to ticks >= 591 because the 65536-record ring had wrapped on both sides.

## Gate capture, 2026-09-06: all four remaining integer gates agree; the float does not

Both machines ran with the new probes (client `c3768a1c3`, host
`host_rng_probe.xbe` with binary probes at `0x1a5109` and `0x1a5142`). The
desync reproduced. Scoped to the desynced game:

    shared draw ticks           293  (0 .. 1596)
    agree                       282
    first divergent seed tick   1478
    transitions before 1478     client-only: (1474, 0xe33a0035, new=2 old=0)
                                host-only:   none
    gate snapshots compared     5579
    gate snapshots differing    0

**Zero.** Every time both machines reach the fork for the same unit on the same
tick, all four surviving runtime gate inputs are identical. At the causing tick:

    t=1474  CLIENT  +0x42a=0  +0x257=2  +0x1b4&0x4000=0  +0x1b8&0x100=0
    t=1474  HOST    +0x42a=0  +0x257=2  +0x1b4&0x4000=0  +0x1b8&0x100=0

So the integer gates are exonerated by measurement, not by argument. **The
`fcomp` at `0x1a5169` is the only remaining difference.**

### And the float gap is gross, not sub-ULP

The host probe recorded the compared operand. For that unit, on every tick from
1474 onward:

    probe:turn_cosine  bits=0x3f800000  = 1.0   (exactly)

The threshold is `0.99` (`0x3f7d70a4` at `0x28ace8`), i.e. the cosine of about
8.1 degrees. Working the branch:

    fld dword [ebp-0xc]     ; ST(0) = cosine
    fcomp st(1)             ; vs threshold
    fnstsw ax               ; C0 -> ah bit 0, C2 -> ah bit 2
    test ah,5               ; C0|C2
    jp 0x1a5193             ; PF=1 (C0=0, cosine > threshold) -> SKIP the turn

The host's biped was facing **exactly** where it wanted to face, so it correctly
skipped the turn-in-place animation. Our client took the transition, so our
cosine was **below 0.99** -- more than eight degrees of facing error against the
original's zero.

**This retires the sub-ULP precision hypothesis for this site.** A last-bit
rounding difference cannot move a cosine from 1.0 to below 0.99. Our biped's
current facing (`+0x24`) and desired facing (`+0x1d4`) genuinely diverge, by a
visible angle, where the original holds them identical. The x87-narrowing lane
is not the explanation here; something in the ported facing update is wrong by
a wide margin, and the knife-edge reading of the six-tick excursion was the
wrong model.

Two caveats on this run:

- The threshold is selected by `test al,0x20` on `+0x1b8` (`0x1a5151`). Bit 0x20
  set uses the `0.99` constant; clear uses the tag value at `+0x4c8`. The gate
  probe records bit 0x100, not bit 0x20, so which threshold applied is not yet
  captured. It does not change the conclusion: the host was at exactly 1.0 and
  did not fire.
- Only the host records `probe:turn_cosine`. `[ebp-0xc]` lives inside the
  unported fork, so the client needs its own binary probe, or an equivalent
  value computed in the ported caller, to state our cosine as a number rather
  than as an inequality.

Note the transition state was **2** this run and **3** in repro B. `setne dl;
add dl,2` selects on `[ebp-1]`, the turn direction, so that difference is which
way the biped turned, not a different fault.

## RETRACTED: "our build desyncs against itself"

**Struck 2026-09-06, same day.** The user later reported the opposite: the same
patched build on both machines does **not** desync. The section below is kept
for the record but its conclusion is wrong.

Most likely reconciliation, consistent with every observation: the earlier
patched-against-patched test ran two patched builds at *different revisions*.
Different code desyncs. Identical code does not.

    pristine    vs pristine    -> no desync
    patched X   vs patched X   -> no desync   (measured, clean-run baseline below)
    patched     vs pristine    -> desync      (all captures in this document)
    patched X   vs patched Y   -> desync      (the misread test)

So the simulation is deterministic and the original framing holds: our code
computes a different value than the original. The non-determinism hypotheses
below (uninitialized stack, pointer values, timing) are not supported and are
not being pursued. The clean-run baseline that follows this section is still
valid and still useful -- it shows the probes agree bit for bit when both
machines run identical code, which is the control the instrument needed.

## Superseded reframe: our build desyncs against ITSELF

User report, and it changes the target of the whole investigation:

- pristine `cachebeta` against pristine `cachebeta` -- **no desync**
- our patched build against our patched build -- **desyncs, either machine hosting**
- our patched build against pristine -- desyncs (all captures above)

Two *identical* binaries cannot diverge in a lockstep simulation unless the
simulation is non-deterministic. So the framing used up to this point -- "our
code computes a different value than the original" -- was wrong, or at least
incomplete. The defect is that our code computes a different value **than
another copy of itself**.

That narrows the mechanism class sharply. A deterministic difference from the
original would reproduce identically on both of our machines and could not
desync them against each other. What can differ between two machines running
the same image:

1. **A read of uninitialized stack memory.** The two machines run different
   non-simulation code between ticks (rendering, audio, input, network), so
   stale stack contents differ. This is the classic cause.
2. **A read of uninitialized pool or heap memory** -- a struct field the
   original initializes and we do not. A `pad_` field that turns out to be read
   is exactly this bug.
3. **A pointer value used in arithmetic.** Addresses need not match.
4. **Dependence on wall-clock or frame timing rather than tick count.**

The facing evidence still stands and becomes more useful: with both machines
running our build, both log the reconstructed cosine (kind 21) and the forward
z (kind 22) from source. No binary patch is needed, and any difference between
the two is by definition our own non-determinism.

### Uninitialized-read sweep: 51 warnings, top candidates are false positives

    clang -Wconditional-uninitialized -Wuninitialized   (full tree, gnu90)
    -> 51 warnings; artifacts/scratch/uninit.txt

Concentrations: `encounters.c` 9, `units.c` 7, `objects.c` 7,
`breakable_surfaces.c` 6, `model_animations.c` 3.

The animation-path hits looked promising and are **not** bugs. Both
`units.c:247/277/298` (`has_rotation`, `has_translation`, `has_scale`) and
`model_animations.c:1385/1404/1429` (`local_14`, `local_1c`, `local_20`) load
inside `if ((node_idx & 0x1f) == 0)` in a loop whose index starts at zero, so
the first iteration always initializes them. clang cannot prove the loop runs
at least once with index 0. The remaining 45 are unreviewed.

This sweep is worth keeping as a standing check, but it did not find the fault.

### Clean-run baseline, and the `f.z` hypothesis is refuted

Both machines on our build, one full game, no desync. Scoped to that game:

    tick range              2417 .. 4589 on both
    seed ticks compared     418, all agreeing
    probe:turn_cos_c        7454 compared, 0 differing
    probe:turn_fwd_z        7454 compared, 0 differing
    probe:turn_gates        7454 compared, 0 differing

So when the game does not desync, the two machines agree bit for bit on every
value this fork reads. The instrument is sound and any difference in a
desyncing run is real.

**`f.z` is always exactly zero in our build** -- 7454 of 7454 samples, min and
max both 0. The hypothesis that a non-zero forward z was dragging the 2D dot
below the threshold is therefore **wrong**. Our cosine falls below 0.99 because
the biped genuinely is turning in the XY plane, which is the normal case: 1292
of 7454 samples sit below the threshold in an ordinary game.

What remains is unchanged: get a desyncing run with these probes on both
machines. The first differing `probe:turn_cos_c` names the tick and unit, and
from there the question is which input to the facing update went wrong.

## The caller-side cosine reconstruction is INVALID: the fork updates `+0x24` first

Kind 21 samples `+0x1d4` and `+0x24` in the ported caller, immediately before
`FUN_001a4c50`. That is not equivalent to what the fork compares, because the
fork **writes the current facing in place** before computing the cosine:

    0x1a4dd5  lea ecx, [esi + 0x24]          ; ecx = current facing
    ...                                       ; (no reassignment of ecx)
    0x1a4f08  mov eax, [ebp-0x20]
    0x1a4f0b  mov edx, [ebp-0x1c]
    0x1a4f0e  mov [ecx],   eax               ; <-- turns the biped
    0x1a4f13  mov [ecx+4], edx
    0x1a4f16  mov [ecx+8], eax
    ...
    0x1a5061  lea eax, [esi + 0x1d4]         ; only now is the cosine built
    0x1a50cd  fstp dword ptr [ebp-0xc]

So kind 21 reads the facing one update too early. It is correct only for a
biped that is not turning, where the write is a no-op.

The paired capture shows exactly that signature, and it is the reason the
control failed:

    unit 0xe2710002   128 samples   128 identical   every value exactly 1.0
    unit 0xe2740005   128 samples   128 identical   every value exactly 1.0
    unit 0xe27a000b   128 samples   128 identical   every value exactly 1.0
    unit 0xe2770008   128 samples     0 identical   the only unit that moves

**All 384 agreeing samples are the constant 1.0 from stationary bipeds.** This
is the vacuous-agreement trap: a control that passes only where the quantity
under test is constant proves nothing. The one moving unit disagreed on every
sample, and that disagreement is the probe's error, not a simulation
divergence. No conclusion about our simulation can be drawn from this capture.

Kinds 23 to 27 (the raw components) have the same defect and are equally
invalid; they sample the same pre-update values.

**Correct fix:** the client needs the same *binary* probe the host has, at
`0x1a5142`, reading `[ebp-0xc]`. `FUN_001a4c50` is unported in our build too,
so the identical patch applies at the identical address. The obstacle is cave
space: `build_original_probes.py` hides its caves inside
`unit_update_animation`'s body, which is dead in the baseline build but live in
ours. Our build needs a dedicated reserved buffer instead.

## MEASURED 2026-09-06: our desired facing never leaves the current facing

First capture with a binary probe on BOTH machines at the same instruction
(client `tools/xbox/patch_fork_probes.py`, host
`artifacts/rng_trace/build_original_probes.py`), kind 20 = `[ebp-0xc]` at
0x1a5142, the operand of the fork's `fcomp`.

    client: 2 distinct cosine values in the whole game
              0x3f800000 (1.0)          384 samples
              0x3f7fffff (0.99999994)   128 samples
    host:  19 distinct values, a real sweep -0.986 .. +0.998 .. -0.99

    shared (tick,unit) cosine keys 511, DIFFERING 127
    unit 0xe2770008, ticks 2..22: client 1.0 flat, host swings through a
    full turn (-0.986 -> +0.998 -> +0.924)

Each of the four units is pinned to ONE bit-exact value for all 130 ticks.
A cosine that never moves off 1.0 by even an ulp means the fork is dotting a
vector with itself.

The gates are NOT the difference. Same capture, same probe pair:

    shared gate keys 520, DIFFERING 2 (t=1 and t=5, one unit, one-tick phase)
    every sample: +0x257=2, +0x1b4&0x4000=0, +0x1b8&0x100=0

### Why 1.0 is the self-dot signature

Disassembly of the fork at 0x1a5061..0x1a50cd:

    0x1a5061 copy (+0x1d4,+0x1d8,+0x1dc) to [ebp-0x20], force z = 0
    0x1a5083 call 0x12f10 (normalize3d), returns length in ST0
    0x1a5088 fcomp [0x2533c0] ; test ah,0x44 ; jp 0x1a50ac
             -> length == that constant falls through to the FALLBACK
    0x1a5098 fallback: copy the CURRENT facing (+0x24) over [ebp-0x20]
    0x1a50ac cross-z  = d.x*f.y - d.y*f.x            -> [ebp-1] turn direction
    0x1a50bc cosine   = d.x*f.x + d.y*f.y            -> [ebp-0xc] COMPARED
    0x1a50e4 fcomp [0x2568c0] ; test ah,5 ; jp 0x1a5109

With d = f the cosine is f.x^2 + f.y^2, which is 1.0 for a normalized facing
with f.z = 0 (and 0x3f7fffff for one that is an ulp short). So on our build the
desired facing either normalizes to zero, or already equals the current facing.

### The producer chain, traced to one field

Every instruction in .text that references offset 0x1d4 was decoded (50 sites)
and mapped to its kb.json function. The per-tick writer is `unit_set_control`
(0x1af990, ported), at 0x1afcfb:

    unit+0x1d4 <- control+0x1c        (facing_vector)
    unit+0x1e0 <- control+0x28        (aiming_vector)
    unit+0x204 <- control+0x34        (looking_vector)

Our C at units.c:10273 matches the original store-for-store. The fault is
upstream of it. Two producers fill that control block:

    AI     actors.c:7652   control+0x1c <- actor->output_facing_vector (+0x718)
    player players.c:3074  control+0x1c <- unit+0x1d4 (a self-copy, input off)

and `output_facing_vector` has exactly one writer, actor_looking.c:9303, which
stores `actor->control_desired_facing_vector` (+0x5a4). That field is written
by actor_moving.c in three places:

    3686  = actor->input_facing_vector (+0x174)   <- THE DEFAULT, self-facing
    3837  = normalized (actor+0x12c - actor+0x6a8), guarded by normalize3d != 0
    3924  = -vec_scratch, vehicle-stuck arm

Line 3686 is the default assignment at the top of the function: desired facing
:= input facing. Our measurement is exactly what that default produces if no
later branch overwrites it. `actor_move_compute_avoidance` (actor_moving) was already suspect
number 1 from the x87-narrowing ranking, reached independently.

### Open, and the next measurement

Which link breaks is NOT yet measured. Three candidates, in order:

1. actor_moving never leaves the 3686 default (a branch condition is wrong).
2. actor_look_update overwrites +0x5a4 or fails to propagate it.
3. the units are player bipeds, not actors, and players.c takes the
   input-disabled arm at 3063 -- which self-copies the facing and would also
   pin the cosine. Settle this first: it changes which file to read.

A CLIENT-ONLY probe answers 1 and 2 -- no host run needed, because the host's
behaviour is already measured. Record, per tick and unit: actor+0x5a4,
actor+0x174, actor+0x718, and unit+0x1d4. If +0x5a4 == +0x174 always, the break
is in actor_moving. If +0x5a4 moves but unit+0x1d4 does not, it is downstream.

Captures: artifacts/rng_trace/cos_{c,h}.json, dbg2{1,4}_cos.txt.
Scripts: artifacts/scratch/{cos_cmp,gate_cmp,find_1d4}.py.

## MEASURED 2026-09-06 (evening): the facing pinning does NOT reproduce solo

Client-only capture, build `7b0dd1fcd` + `patch_fork_probes.py`, campaign c40,
single console, no host, no desync required.  Probes 28/29/30 record
`unit+0x1d4`, `unit+0x24` and the full `unit+0x1b4` flag word immediately before
the `FUN_001a4c50` call in `biped_update_dispatcher`.  Capture:
`artifacts/rng_trace/solo_facing.json` (43643 records, 2794 samples per probe).

    unit                 n    eq  uniq_desired  uniq_current
    handle=0xe52c00ce  163     1           129            81
    handle=0xe52f00d1  163     2            92            72
    handle=0xe53200d4  163     1           108            72
    handle=0xe53500d7  163     2           116            93
    (5 further units held one value for all 162 samples -- stationary)

    probe:turn_cosine  128 samples, 68 distinct, range 0.309026 .. 1.000000

Four bipeds sweep a real turn.  Compare the system-link capture from the same
day: the client held 2 distinct cosine values for the whole game and each of its
four units was pinned to ONE bit-exact value for all 128 samples.

**Conclusion: our engine turns bipeds correctly.  The pinning is specific to the
system-link game, not a local defect.**  That removes the AI path
(`actor_moving.c` 3686/3837/3924) as the suspect for the pinning: c40 exercises
it and it sweeps.

The desync capture ran on `levels\test\prisoner\prisoner`, a multiplayer map with
no AI actors, so its four units were PLAYER bipeds, which take the `players.c`
path instead.  Its input-disabled arm (`players.c:3043-3089`, gated on
`players_globals+0x29 != 0`) copies `unit+0x1d4..0x1dc` into the control it then
feeds to `unit_set_control`, which writes them straight back to `unit+0x1d4`.
That freezes the desired facing.  A biped whose desired facing already equals its
current facing then never turns, so both stay frozen -- exactly the measured
symptom.

`players_globals+0x29` has exactly one writer, `player_input_enable`
(`players.c:299`), called from `cinematics.c:35/261` and from the script host in
`hs.c`.  A multiplayer game runs no cutscene, so the byte should be 0.

NOT YET MEASURED, and the next step: probe `players_globals+0x29` and which arm
`players.c` takes, per player per tick, then capture one system-link game.  Until
that runs, "our client takes the input-disabled arm in MP" is a hypothesis built
on a chain of inference, not a measurement.

## CORRECTION 2026-09-06 (late): the section above overstates its evidence

The section above says the solo capture showed four bipeds sweeping the turn
cosine.  That is wrong.  Those four handles came from probe kinds 28/29
(`desired_x` / `current_x`), not from `probe:turn_cosine`.  Re-reading
`artifacts/rng_trace/solo_facing.json` by kind gives a different picture:

    solo       gates=2924  cosine=128   one unit only, 0xe45f01f0
               0xe45f01f0  128 samples, 68 distinct, 0.309026 .. 1.000000

One unit sweeps solo, not four.  The claim "our engine turns bipeds correctly"
was therefore built on the wrong column.  What the solo run does still prove is
narrower and still useful: our build CAN produce a non-1.0 cosine.

The section above also asserts the four pinned MP units "were PLAYER bipeds".
That was never checked.  The handle indices support it but do not prove it: the
four MP units are 0xe271**0002**, 0xe274**0005**, 0xe277**0008**, 0xe27a**000b**
-- object indices 2, 5, 8, 11, evenly spaced by 3, allocated first.  The two
others, 0xe45f0**1f0** and 0xe52c0**2b0** (indices 496 and 688), are a different
family and appear in the solo capture too.  Treat "player biped" as a strong
lead, not a fact.

## MEASURED 2026-09-06 (late): the client never produces a non-1.0 cosine

Re-reading the paired MP capture (`artifacts/rng_trace/cos_c.json`,
`cos_h.json`) by kind and by unit:

    mp_client  847 cosine samples over 6 units -- every one exactly 1.0
    mp_host   1848 cosine samples over 6 units -- two units vary:
               0xe2770008  17 distinct, -0.986069 .. 0.998360
               0xe45f01f0  14 distinct,  0.976600 .. 1.000000

A cosine pinned at exactly 1.0 is the self-dot signature: `unit+0x1d4` equals
`unit+0x24`.  On our client that holds for every unit, every tick, with no
exception in 847 samples.

Two gate findings, both of which REMOVE suspects rather than adding one:

1. `f257` (`unit+0x257`, bits 8-15 of kind 19) explains the units that never
   reach the cosine at all.  Every unit with `f257 == 3` reaches it 0% of the
   time, on the client, on the host, and solo.  That early exit is shared.  It
   is not the divergence.

2. The apparent "client reaches the cosine 29% of the time, host 99%" is an
   artifact of mixing two probes.  The client emits kind 19 from BOTH the
   source-level probe in the ported caller (`object_update+242`) and the binary
   probe in the fork (`FUN_001a4c50+1209`); the pristine host has only the
   second.  Counting the fork probe alone, both machines reach the cosine on
   ~99% of fork entries.  There is no gate divergence.

3. There is no per-tick call-count difference either.  An earlier draft of this
   section reported the host entering the fork twice per tick against the
   client's once.  That was a segmentation error.  Both rings wrapped
   (write_index 71991 and 73943 against capacity 65536), the tick counter
   resets at every `game_initialize_for_new_map`, and grouping by `tick` alone
   merged several map instances.  The host's retained window holds the SAME
   instance twice: segments `[58235:61873]` and `[61898:65536]` produce
   identical per-unit counts and identical cosine histograms.  Split at the
   markers, both machines enter the fork once per tick.  Always segment these
   captures at `game_initialize_for_new_map` before counting anything.

## The divergence, measured within one map instance

Client segment `[62585:65511]`, ticks 0..129, against host segment
`[58235:61873]`, ticks 0..213.  Same four unit handles, so the same game
instance and the same objects.  One fork entry per tick on both sides.

    unit          client distinct cos      host distinct cos
    0xe2710002    1  (1.000000 x128)       1  (1.000000 x212)
    0xe2740005    1  (1.000000 x128)       1  (1.000000 x212)
    0xe2770008    1  (1.000000 x128)      17  (0.924332 x144, -0.986069 x2, ...)
    0xe27a000b    1  (1.000000 x128)       1  (1.000000 x162)

And in the earlier instance, client `[43722:62559]` against host
`[41770:58209]`:

    0xe45f01f0    1  (1.000000 x167)      14  (1.000000 x180, 0.979389 x1, ...)
    0xe52c02b0    1  (1.000000 x168)       1  (1.000000 x159)

Three of the four units in the later instance agree at 1.0 on both machines, so
1.0 is a normal value: it is what a biped that is not turning produces.  The
divergence is that for 0xe2770008, and for 0xe45f01f0 in the earlier instance,
the host produces a varying cosine over a sustained run of ticks while our
client produces exactly 1.0 and never anything else.  0xe2770008's host value
sits at 0.924332 for 144 of its 164 ticks, so any overlap with the client's
130-tick window should have shown it.

This also disposes of the host-extra-pass alternative, and it does so without
having to assume which pass corresponds to the client's entry.  There is only
one pass per tick on each machine.  The host varies within that single pass and
the client does not.

Across the whole capture our client emitted 847 cosine samples over six units
and every one of them was exactly 1.0.  A cosine of exactly 1.0 is the self-dot
signature: `unit+0x1d4` equals `unit+0x24`.  On our client that holds without a
single exception.

## What is still not excluded

These two captures still differ in two variables, not one: patched build AND
client role, against pristine build AND host role.  The pinning could be stock
client behavior for a unit the client does not simulate authoritatively.

The control that separates them is
`artifacts/rng_trace/host_rng_baseline.xbe`, a build with every ported function
deactivated except the ring-logger keep-list -- original game code carrying our
trace ring.  Deploy it to the CLIENT slot (10.0.0.21), let 10.0.0.24 host, and
capture one game.

- If that baseline client also pins every cosine at 1.0, the pinning is stock
  client behavior and the cosine lead dies.
- If the baseline client varies where ours does not, the pinning is ours, and
  the writer of `unit+0x1d4` on the client path is the target.

The `players.c` input-disabled-arm hypothesis in the section above is NOT
supported by anything measured here.  Its two supports both failed: the four MP
units are only inferred to be player bipeds from their handle indices, and the
solo "four sweeping bipeds" that motivated eliminating the AI path was the wrong
probe column.  Treat it as unranked until the control run says the pinning is
ours at all.

## VERIFIED 2026-09-06: the host capture really did run original code

The control-run plan assumed `cos_h.json` came from a build with our ports
deactivated.  That assumption was never checked.  It is now, and it holds.

`rng_trace_dump.py` records a `caller_space` field per record: `"xbe"` when the
return address falls in the original image, `"impl"` when it falls in our
appended code.  Every host record is `"xbe"`:

    cos_h.json  probe:anim_update_in   unit_update_animation  0x1b0f5d  xbe
                probe:unit_state       unit_update_animation  0x1b121c  xbe
                probe:turn_gates       FUN_001a4c50           0x1a5109  xbe
                probe:turn_cosine      FUN_001a4c50           0x1a5142  xbe
                random_math_real       FUN_0010a830           0x10a85d  xbe

    cos_c.json  probe:anim_update_in   unit_update_animation  0x6ecc14  impl
                probe:unit_state       unit_update_animation  0x6ecd8e  impl
                probe:turn_gates       object_update          0x785742  impl
                probe:turn_gates       FUN_001a4c50           0x1a5109  xbe
                random_math_real       FUN_0010a830           0x725563  impl

The host's kinds 16-18 are binary probes patched at original addresses, not
source-level probes in ported wrappers.  So the host ran original game code and
the client ran ours.  The measured cosine divergence is not an artifact of both
machines running the same build.

This also explains why `xbeinfo running` on 10.0.0.24 now reports a patched
`default.xbe`: `host_diagnostic.py probes` magicboots `rng_probe.xbe` for the
capture, and any power cycle returns the console to `default.xbe`.  The host
needs that magicboot again before the control run.  It does not mean the earlier
capture was taken from the wrong image.

## CONTROL RUN 2026-09-06: the cosine pinning belongs to our build

Configuration: 10.0.0.24 hosted `rng_probe.xbe` (original code, binary probes).
10.0.0.21 joined on `rng_baseline.xbe` (our build, 5439 ports deactivated, the
same binary fork probes, `random_math.obj` kept so the ring still records).
Only one variable changed against the earlier capture: the CLIENT now ran
original game code.

Provenance self-check passed.  On the client, `probe:turn_gates` came only from
`FUN_001a4c50` in `xbe` space.  The source-level `object_update` probe of the
ported build did not appear, so the baseline image really was the running title.

**The game did not desync.**

The baseline client produces non-1.0 cosines, and the two machines agree:

    ctrl_c seg[58439:64822]              ctrl_h seg[34115:63629]
    0xe2ad003e  9 distinct  1.0 x925     0xe2ad003e  9 distinct  1.0 x1506
    0xe2a40035  1.0 x303, 0.998661 x1    0xe2a40035  1.0 x303, 0.998661 x1
    0xe2a70038  1.0 x265                 0xe2a70038  1.0 x265
    0xe2ee006e  1.0 x113                 0xe2ee006e  1.0 x113
    0xe2aa003b 14 distinct               0xe2aa003b 15 distinct
    earlier segment, client only:
    0xe3ee0037  1.0 x689, 0.959091 x259
    0xe44e0039  0.974928 x499, 0.819021 x86, 0.034873 x1

Same handles, same values, same counts.  That is lockstep.

Compare the ported client: 847 cosine samples over six units, every one exactly
1.0.  The pinning is therefore NOT stock client behavior and NOT a role effect.
It is produced by our lifted code.

A cosine of exactly 1.0 is the self-dot signature, so on our build `unit+0x1d4`
equals `unit+0x24`.  The target is the writer of `unit+0x1d4` on the client
path.  Three candidates were named earlier: `unit_set_control`'s producer,
`unit_update`'s static arm, and `players.c`'s input-disabled arm.

Captures: `artifacts/rng_trace/ctrl_c.json`, `artifacts/rng_trace/ctrl_h.json`.

### Capturing from a baseline image

`build/halo` is normally a non-trace build, so `rng_trace_dump.py` cannot find
`halo_rng_trace` and the ring VA must be supplied.  For `baseline_client.xbe`
the ring sits at 0x803d04, read out of the `rng_trace_note` prologue in the XBE
rather than from a PE export:

    python3 tools/xbox/rng_trace_dump.py --host 10.0.0.21 \
        --pe artifacts/rng_trace/session_symbols.pe \
        --runtime-base 0x646404 --out artifacts/rng_trace/ctrl_c.json

0x646404 = 0x642000 + (0x803d04 - 0x7ff900).  The offset shifts impl-space
symbol names by the same amount, which is harmless for a baseline capture
because almost every caller is in `xbe` space.  The host ring stays at
0x7ff900 and needs only `--pe`.

### The paired rate, which is the number that matters

Per-unit tables understate this.  The right comparison is the non-1.0 cosine
rate inside one game, client against host:

    run                        client non-1.0        host non-1.0
    ported   cos_c / cos_h     0/512    0.00%        162/748   21.66%
    baseline ctrl_c / ctrl_h   30/2136  1.40%        54/3520    1.53%

The baseline pair agrees to 0.13 percentage points.  The ported pair differs by
21.7 points.  The absolute rate differs between the two games only because the
players moved differently, so only the within-pair agreement is meaningful.

Zero out of 512 against an expected 21.66% is not a sampling accident.  Our
ported client does not produce a non-1.0 turn cosine in an MP client role.

### Our build turns correctly in SOLO

`solo_facing.json` carries kinds 28/29/30 from the ported build.  For four AI
units, `unit+0x1b4` bit 0 is set on every sample and `unit+0x1d4` differs from
`unit+0x24`:

    0xe52c00ce  n=297  differ 295  equal 2   bit0=1 always
    0xe52f00d1  n=297  differ 293  equal 4   bit0=1 always
    0xe53200d4  n=297  differ 294  equal 3   bit0=1 always
    0xe53500d7  n=297  differ 294  equal 3   bit0=1 always
    0xe45c01ed  n=296  differ   0  equal 296 bit0=1 always
    0xe45001e1  n=295  differ   0  equal 295 bit0=1 always

So the static arm is not firing, and our facing pipeline works outside a network
client role.  The defect is specific to the MP client path.

### `unit_update`'s two arms are a faithful lift, so they are not the defect

Disassembly of 0x1b3690, against `units.c` `unit_update`:

    1b3741  mov  eax, [ebx+0x1b4]
    1b3747  test eax, 0x2000000      -> running-blind arm  (matches our C)
    1b374c  je   0x1b37b1
    1b37b1  test al, 1               -> static arm when bit 0 is CLEAR
    1b37b3  jne  0x1b3820
    1b37ea  lea  ecx, [ebx+0x1d4]    -> writes desired facing from +0x24

Our `else if ((unit[0x6d] & 1) == 0)` reproduces `test al,1 / jne`.  Combined
with the solo measurement (bit 0 set on every sample), the static arm is not the
writer that pins the cosine.

Remaining writer of `unit+0x1d4` on a client: `unit_set_control`, which copies
control data `cd+0x1c` into the unit.  That is the next target.

## The divergence is ONE unit, and three units match bit-for-bit

Raw cosine bits from the paired capture, same map instance:

    unit         cos_h (pristine host)          cos_c (our client)
    0xe2710002   0x3f7fffff x212                0x3f7fffff x128
    0xe2740005   0x3f800000 x212                0x3f800000 x128
    0xe27a000b   0x3f800000 x162                0x3f800000 x128
    0xe2770008   0x3f6ca109 x144 + 17 others    0x3f800000 x128

Three units agree to the bit, including the one-ULP value 0x3f7fffff.  Our
cosine arithmetic is therefore exact.  Only `0xe2770008` diverges: the host
holds 0.924332, a steady 22.4 degree offset between desired facing and body
forward, while our client holds exactly 1.0.

The earlier "our client pins every cosine at 1.0" framing was too broad.  Three
of the four units are at 1.0 on BOTH machines because those bipeds are not
turning.  The finding is one unit, not four.

### Restricting the host to the client's tick window confirms it

Both segments belong to one map instance, so ticks are comparable.  Host ticks
0..129 against the client's full 130 ticks, `probe:anim_update_in` state[0]:

    unit         host ticks 0..129        client ticks 0..129
    0xe2710002   0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1       0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1
    0xe2740005   0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1       0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1
    0xe27a000b   0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1       0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1
    0xe2770008   0xa8 x113, 0xbd x15,     0xa8 x128, 0xaa x1
                 0xaa x1

Same tick range, same unit, same three controls.  The host plays animation 0xbd
on unit 8 for 15 ticks.  Our client never leaves 0xa8.

The fork gates are identical on both machines for all four units (`+0x42a` mode
0, `+0x257` = 2, bits 16 and 17 clear), so the fork takes the same path.  The
difference enters upstream: on our client `unit+0x1d4` never differs from
`unit+0x24` for unit 8, so no turn is requested and animation 0xbd never starts.

### Leading hypothesis

During that window the player at unit 8 was turning.  The four handles are
object indices 2, 5, 8 and 11.  If that player sat at the host console, then our
client is failing to apply a REMOTE player's facing.  That points at the code
that fills `action_buf` for remote players in `players_update_before_game`
(`player_control_get_current_actions`, then `player_build_action_update`), not
at `unit_set_control`, which copies `cd+0x1c` into `unit+0x1d4` faithfully.

`unit_set_actively_controlled` (0x1adf10) was checked against disassembly and is
a faithful lift, so it is not the source of a cleared bit 0.

Next measurement: a `--rng-trace` build with the existing kind 28/29/30 probes
at the fork call site in `units.c`, which report `unit+0x1d4`, `unit+0x24` and
`unit+0x1b4` directly for every unit each tick.

## ROOT CAUSE LOCATED 2026-09-06: unit 0xe2740005 turns one tick late, into the wrong state

Capture: `artifacts/rng_trace/ds_c.json` (our full ported build, `--rng-trace`,
fork probes) against `artifacts/rng_trace/ds_h.json` (original code, binary
probes).  Tool: `tools/xbox/rng_first_divergence.py`, which segments both rings
by map instance before comparing.  `rng_trace_dump.py --diff` cannot do this: it
aligns at record 0 and reports a false divergence when the rings hold different
numbers of map instances.

    first diverging tick: 2
      tick 2
           unit 0xe2710002  A state 0x0300   B state 0x0300
        !! unit 0xe2740005  A state -        B state 0x0300
           unit 0xe27a000b  A state 0x0300   B state 0x0300
           draw  random_math_real model_animation_choose_random 0x53a5f8a3 | same
           draw  random_math_real model_animation_choose_random 0xe4d885a6 | same
        !! draw  -                            | random_math_real ... 0x2de3e0cd
      tick 3
        !! unit 0xe2740005  A state 0x0200   B state -
        !! draw  random_math_real ... 0x2de3e0cd | -

The seed VALUES are identical.  0x53a5f8a3, 0xe4d885a6 and 0x2de3e0cd appear on
both machines in that order.  The LCG is not the problem.  The draw happens on
the WRONG TICK, which is enough to fail the per-tick lockstep seed check.

Two of the four units, 0xe2710002 and 0xe27a000b, take state 3 at tick 2 on both
machines.  Only 0xe2740005 differs, and it differs twice over:

    host    tick 2  animation state 3, animation 0xbd
    client  tick 3  animation state 2, animation 0xbc

State 2 against state 3 is the turn-in-place direction that `FUN_001a4c50`
selects.  So the unit turns the other way, one tick late.

### Why: the desired facing arrives one tick late for that unit

Kinds 28/29 read `unit+0x1d4` and `unit+0x24` in the fork's caller:

    client tick 2  0xe2740005  desired 0x3f800000  current 0x3f800000  equal
    client tick 3  0xe2740005  desired 0x3b6ef322  current 0x3f800000  differ

At tick 2 our client still holds the old desired facing, so no turn is
requested.  The value arrives at tick 3, by which time the true turn delta has
changed sign and the fork picks state 2 instead of 3.

The other two turning units get their desired facing on time, so the control
path works in general.  `unit+0x1b4` is 0x41 for every unit on every sample, so
bit 0 is set and `unit_update`'s static arm is not involved.  That kills the
static-arm hypothesis from the previous section for good.

### What this retires

The turn cosine was a symptom, not the defect.  Chasing the cosine writer was
looking one step downstream of the real event, which is the tick on which
`unit_set_control` receives the new facing for one specific unit.

The next question is why unit 0xe2740005 alone is late.  The four handles are
object indices 2, 5, 8 and 11.  Whether index 5 is the client's own local player
or a remote one decides between a local-prediction ordering bug and a network
decode ordering bug.

## CORRECTION 2026-09-07: not a timing error -- unit 0xe2740005 spawned at a different point

The "one tick late" reading above is wrong. Re-reading the same captures with
`rng_first_divergence.py` restricted to the last segment (the ring had wrapped,
which is why the first dumps broke at the tick-264 marker record):

- Unit 2's desired-facing update lands at tick 3 on BOTH machines. There is no
  offset between host and client in when control reaches a unit.
- At tick 2 the host's unit 5 already faces yaw ~89.8 degrees (cos 0.0036); the
  client's unit 5 faces (1, 0, 0). Same seeds, same inputs, different pose one
  tick after the unit exists: the two machines placed unit 5 at different spawn
  points. Unit 5 is the host's second local player; its controller yaw was
  seeded from its (correctly placed) unit by player_control_new_unit.

The spawn choice is `find_best_starting_location_index`: argmax over
`pow(random, 0.5) * rating`. The random draws are identical on both machines,
so the rating must differ. Two functions in the rating chain were mis-lifted
in `src/halo/game/game_engine.c`:

1. `game_engine_get_distance_rating_for_spawn` (0xad9b0) dropped the FSQRT at
   0xada4d. It compared distance SQUARED against the 0.25 / 1.0 / 2.0 / 5.0
   thresholds and fed it into the `(dist - 2.0) * rating * 0.3333` ramp.
2. `FUN_000adb20` (same-team proximity) computed `fmod(dist, 1.9)` where the
   original does `pow(1.0 - (dist - 1.0) * 0.2, 0.6)` via _CIpow (0x26c6b0 is
   the double 0.6; 0x26b678 is an unrelated double), and used `dist < 6.0` for
   the `FCOMP / TEST AH,0x41 / JP` guard that means `dist <= 6.0`.

Both also lacked the float32 narrowing of `dist` (`FSTP dword [ebp-8]`), which
`tools/audit/check_x87_narrowing.py` flagged for exactly these two functions.

Why it is intermittent: the ratings only leave 1.0 when another unit is alive
within ~5 (enemy) or 6 (teammate) world units of a spawn point, and a wrong
rating only flips the argmax when the random factors of the top candidates are
close. The RNG draw COUNT is unchanged by the ratings, so nothing shows until a
flipped spawn moves a unit and that unit's animation choices consume RNG
differently. That is why the first visible divergence is an animation draw at
tick 2, not a spawn.

Fix: both functions rewritten against the disassembly, with
`HALO_FLT_ROUNDTRIP(dist)` after the sqrt. VC71 shape after the fix:
`FUN_000adb20` 81.1 -> 95.5, `game_engine_get_distance_rating_for_spawn`
87.5 -> 95.0 (120/120 insns, FPU-WARN and FCOM-WARN cleared). No other function
in the TU moved.

Not yet confirmed at runtime. Repro needs two xemu instances in a lobby:

    rtk ./tools/xbox/build_deploy_run.sh --xemu-bridged --xbox 10.0.0.21 -- -q --rng-trace

then re-capture ds_h.json / ds_c.json and run `tools/xbox/rng_first_divergence.py`.

## RUN 2 2026-09-07 (after the spawn-rating fix): tick 2 is clean, next divergence at tick 315

Captures: `artifacts/rng_trace/ds2_h.json` (host 10.0.0.24, `host_rng_probe.xbe`,
ring 0x7ff900) and `ds2_c.json` (client 10.0.0.21, commit 49bce6e75 `--rng-trace`);
`debug_ds2_21.txt` / `debug_ds2_24.txt`.  `rng_first_divergence.py ds2_h ds2_c`:

- Ticks 0..314 identical, every draw and every unit_state / anim_update probe.
  The spawn desync at tick 2 is gone.  (The client shows extra `anim_update_in`
  records from a second call site in `unit_update_animation`, 0x6ecd7a; the
  host detour only covers the 0x1b0f57 site.  Probe coverage, not a divergence.)
- Tick 315: `FUN_0009cb90` (effect event) -> `effect_update` -> `object_cause_damage`
  on both.  Then the HOST damages three more objects, one of them a projectile
  (`projectile_accelerate` via the damage.c type switch case 5, two draws), the
  CLIENT damages one more object and stops.  Client damage probes at 315 name
  only units 0xe2770008 and 0xe2740005, both with damage_scale 0.
- After 315 the seed streams are the same sequence offset by those four draws
  until tick 328, where the client's shot kills a unit (`unit_detach_weapon`,
  `FUN_000460e0`) and the host's does not.  So the whole desync is "an area
  damage effect at tick 315 found 4 candidate objects on the host and 2 on the
  client".  Positions or the candidate query differ silently; nothing in the
  ring shows which objects the host touched.

New probe, kind 31 `probe:damage_target` (value = damage effect tag index
`damage_params[0]`, caller2 = object handle) at `object_cause_damage` entry on
both builds: client `src/halo/objects/damage.c` under `HALO_RNG_TRACE`, host
binary detour at 0x137d20 built by `artifacts/rng_trace/build_original_probes_v2.py`
on top of the v1 image (`host_rng_probe_v1.xbe`, sha eac7fbae...; the v1 input
`host_rng_baseline.xbe` was rebuilt for the control run and no longer matches
sha a2a004b6...).  Unicorn check: registers, flags and every byte at or above
ESP identical to the original prologue path; record = kind 31, tick, jpt tag,
handle.  Host image sha 3a838b03..., deployed with `host_diagnostic.py probes`.
Next capture will list the candidate set on both sides.

## RUN 3 2026-09-07: grenade lands one tick late -- lost float32 narrowing in projectiles.c

Captures `ds3_h.json` / `ds3_c.json` (both builds carry the kind-31 damage probe).
Identical through tick 1008.  Tick 996: grenade throw (`projectile_accelerate`
from units.c, same two scatter draws on both).  Host: impact handler
`FUN_000f90d0` draws at tick 1009; client: the same two draws (same seeds) at
tick 1010.  The grenade flew a slightly different path.

`check_x87_narrowing.py src/halo/items/projectiles.c` flagged
`projectile_accelerate` (ours 0 narrowed slots, xbe 3): the original FSTPs the
squared scatter magnitude before the FSQRT (0xf9001) and the dir[1]/dir[2]
scatter components (0xf9032/0xf903a) while dir[0]*scale is added wide.  Fixed
in 0b211d249 together with `FUN_000f7fa0`.  The remaining three flagged
functions (`FUN_000f9c40` projectile update, `FUN_000f90d0` impact handler,
`projectile_aim_ballistic`) were aligned site by site in 9e0ddb9cb; the TU now
reports 0 MISSING-NARROWING and no VC71 score moved.

Checker gap found on the way: `narrowing_slots()` only recognises a reload as
`fld dword [slot]`; a slot consumed by `fsub/fdiv/fmul/fcomp dword [slot]` is
invisible, so the reported deltas understate the real gap (four such slots in
`projectile_aim_ballistic` alone: t_min, two_a, b, V).  Follow-up: extend the
checker, then re-run it over every TU that touches simulation state.

Run 2's tick-315 case (area damage candidate set 4 vs 2) is most likely the
same class -- an explosion position that differs in the low bits -- and has
not been reproduced since the kind-31 probe went in; the next capture that
shows it will name the objects on both sides.

## RUN 4 (2026-09-07) — first divergence tick 330, area-damage candidate set again

Same class as run 2, now named by the kind-31 `damage_target` probe. A grenade thrown
at tick 319 detonated at 330. Per damage effect, the set of objects that reached
`object_cause_damage`:

| effect       | host (pristine)                              | client (ours) |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `0xe3780204` | `..05`, `..02`, `0xe29c002c` (the projectile) | `..05`        |
| `0xe37a0206` | `..2b`, `0xe29c002c`                          | `..2b`        |

Missing on the client: `0xe2710002` and `0xe29c002c`. Two candidate causes, both
inside the ported `FUN_00138e30` area-damage path:

1. the ported radius query (`object_find_in_radius` → `structure_find_in_cluster` /
   `object_find_in_cluster`) returned fewer candidates (x87 narrowing checks on those
   are clean, so if it is this, it is something else);
2. the unported applier `FUN_00138900` rejected the candidates, most likely via the
   ported LOS test `FUN_0014df70`.

**Instrumentation added (both sides):** kind 32 `radius_hit`, recorded at the accept
branch of `object_find_in_radius` (client: `objects.c` before
`out_handles[found_count] = handle`; host: detour 6 at 0x141793, cave impl+0x460,
unicorn-verified register/flag/stack-preserving). Record: value = `found_count`,
caller2 = accepted object handle. Comparing the kind-32 sets at the divergent tick
decides between (1) and (2). Host image sha256 73efbe99…, 6 patches. Client commit
adcc6dc30.

## RUN 5 (2026-09-07) — tick 1099, radius query is NOT the cause

Kind-32 `radius_hit` sets at tick 1099 are identical on both sides (29 objects,
same order except a 4-entry cluster-list permutation at slots 0xd..0x10). The
grenade `0xe2cf0004` is in both lists, yet only the host applies damage to it
(both effects). So the reject happens inside the unported applier `FUN_00138900`:
for a projectile (not biped/vehicle) the only reject before `object_cause_damage`
is the LOS test `FUN_0014df70` (ported, VC71 84.9%) returning "hit". Static review
of `FUN_0014dce0` and `object_get_root_parent` matched the binary; the candidate
set inside the LOS chain (BSP test, `FUN_0014cb00`, sphere test, zone tracking) is
too large to read, so both sides got a kind-33 `los_result` probe at the LOS exit:
value = `(result<<16) | collision_result.type`, caller2 = hit-t float bits,
guarded to calls returning into `FUN_00138900` (the render path calls the LOS test
thousands of times per frame and flooded the ring in run 6).

Host detour lessons: the second epilogue is entered mid-way by three `JE 0x14e62b`
branches, so a 6-byte detour at 0x14e628 crashed the host (EIP 0x14e62c, landed
inside the JMP). Fix: redirect the first epilogue into the second and detour once
at 0x14e62b (stolen POP EDI/ESI/EBX; MOV ESP,EBP). Always scan for branches that
land inside the stolen range before installing a detour.

Run 6 host data was lost (host rebooted by a redeploy before the dump).
Host image sha256 ca16e603…, 8 patches. Client commits 12990c7d1, 2e7d0e1fb.

## RUN 7 / RUN 8 (2026-09-07) — LOS reject flips both ways; origin identical

Run 7 (tick 966) and run 8 (tick 751) are the same event with opposite outcomes:
the LOS test for one projectile candidate (`0xe2ae0039` / `0xe2bb0039`) returns
"hit at t=0, structure BSP" on one box and "miss" on the other. Run 7: host miss,
client hit. Run 8: host hit, client miss. The kind-34 `damage_origin` probe shows
the explosion origin (x, y) bit-identical on both sides in run 8, and the
`radius_hit` candidate sets and order are identical.

Everything downstream of the origin is either original code on both boxes
(`FUN_00138900`, the bsp3d traversal `FUN_00148eb0`) or a ported leaf verified
against the binary and against our clang codegen: `collision_bsp_test_vector`
(same data struct init and t clamp), `FUN_00148780` (point = t*dir+origin
narrowed to float exactly like the original), `FUN_00146d40` (2D BSP point test,
no spills on either side), `FUN_00061df0` (dword copies). So with an identical
origin the remaining input is the ray direction = target position - origin. A
start point lying on a floor plane makes the "t=0 hit" decision depend on the
sign of dot(direction, normal), which flips with a one-ulp change in the target's
position. The target is a projectile, so the suspect is the projectile/object
physics position update on the client (`FUN_0014f2c0` in collision_usage.c is
flagged by the narrowing checker with two missing float32 stores).

Probe change: `radius_hit` now logs the accepted object's position z bits
(obj+0x58) instead of found_count (host detour 6 reads [ESI+0x58]). Next run
compares the z of the rejected projectile on both sides.

## RUN 9 (2026-09-07) — grenade position drift; FUN_0014f2c0 narrowing fixed

Tick 261, same class: the LOS test for grenade `0xe29b002c` returned hit-at-t=0
on the host (reject) and miss on the client (damage, projectile_accelerate draws).
This time the kind-34 origin differed too (host x/y `c103f26e/40c8735a`, client
`c103d821/40c9c2fd`, about 0.04 world units) and the new radius_hit z showed the
grenade itself at `bed53017` vs `becf0592`. Walking back through the ring, the
same grenade was already 0.009 off in z at tick 187 when an earlier explosion
kicked it (identical RNG draws on both sides). The drift is in the projectile's
flight/bounce physics, not in any RNG-consuming code.

Static walk of the physics step (`FUN_0014f2c0`, collision_usage.c) against
the XBE showed three narrowing mismatches, all invisible to VC71 (cl.exe narrows
by itself):

1. `old_vel_copy[i] *= (1 - t)` — the original stores each product to a float
   slot every clip iteration (FSTP dword [ebp-0x34..-0x2c] at 0x14f60a..33);
   clang kept the three components as 64-bit doubles (`fst qword [ebp-0x80..-0x70]`)
   for the whole loop. Fixed with `HALO_FLT_ROUNDTRIP` after the scaling, and
   also after every velocity/position projection store.
2. Under register pressure clang spilled the *partial* dot product
   `plane[0]*v[0] + plane[1]*v[1]` as a dword (`fstp dword [ebp-0x58]`) — a
   24-bit rounding the original never does (it keeps `dot`, `factor`,
   `pos_dot`, `len_sq`, `dot2`, `scale` in ST(i)). Fixed by typing those
   temporaries `x87_wide_t` (double under clang, float on the VC71 lane) and
   promoting the products that feed them; clang now spills them as qwords.
3. `collision_log_end_time` inlined into the loop: the original narrows only the
   quotient `t` (FSTP dword [ebp+8] at 0x14eefb); inlined clang narrowed the
   numerator and kept `t` wide. Fixed the same way plus `HALO_FLT_ROUNDTRIP(t)`.

`check_x87_narrowing.py` now reports 0 MISSING for collision_usage.c; VC71
unchanged (FUN_0014f2c0 88.9%, collision_log_end_time 69.6%). Note the checker's
count is a net: an extra clang narrowing can hide behind a missing one (the
pre-fix count was 7 vs 9 while ours had one *extra* rounding), so a "0 MISSING"
result does not prove parity — inspect the computed dword stores directly.

None of the 22 other functions the checker flags in real_math.c / collision_bsp.c
/ objects.c are in the static callee closure of `FUN_0014f2c0` (183 functions).
Run 10 pending.

## RUN 9 follow-up (2026-09-07) — narrowing audit of the physics/projectile TUs

Three read-only audits walked the remaining flagged functions in real_math.c,
collision_bsp.c, objects.c (simulation path only) and projectiles.c against the
XBE, slot by slot. Findings applied (all VC71-neutral unless noted):

- **real_math.c `vector_intersects_pill3d`**: real bug, not just precision.
  The closest points were six scalars (`closest_a_x, closest_a_y, ...`) and
  `&closest_a_x` was passed to `fast_vector_intersects_sphere`, which reads
  three floats through the pointer. Clang dead-stripped the y/z scalars, so the
  callee read garbage. Now `float closest_a[3], closest_b[3]`. Also matched the
  reference's narrowing map (`nx/nz/cross_sq/t/inv/d0_d1/d0_sq/d1_sq/diff_*`
  wide; `ny/nxi/nyi/s/s_start/s_end/t_start/t_end/delta_*` narrowed) and its
  addend orders. VC71 80.5% -> 82.2%.
- **real_math.c `FUN_001093b0`** (quaternion to matrix): norm/s/sq0/xx/xy/xz/zz
  stay wide, sq1/sq2/xw/yw/zw/yy/zy narrow; norm accumulates q0-first.
  Introducing a named `sq0` temporary cost 27pp of VC71 (cl.exe spills it), so
  the products are written `s * q[0] * q[3]` as before. 88.7% unchanged.
- **real_math.c `rotate_vector3d_by_sincos`**: `k` and `cy` wide, `cz` narrowed.
  100% unchanged.
- **collision_bsp.c** `bsp3d_test_sphere_recursive` (plane distance `t` wide),
  `FUN_00148370` (`q` and `radius` round-tripped). 93.5% / 89.5% unchanged.
- **objects.c** `object_compute_child_marker_position` (cross-product
  temporaries wide), `object_compute_node_matrices` (row 4..6 products wide),
  `object_compute_function_values` (eleven round-trips plus a wide additive
  stage). 92.4% / 80.2% / 95.3% unchanged.
- **projectiles.c** `projectile_aim_linear` (`dist` round-tripped after
  normalize3d), `projectile_aim_ballistic` (`inv_t` never stored; `t_min`, `V`
  round-tripped; `b` split into wide/narrow copies for the 0xf81ad FST-no-pop
  shape), `FUN_000f8720` (`dx/dy/dz` and the `dir1[i]*radius` products wide,
  `pt_b1z` never narrowed), `FUN_000f9c40` (`dz` FST-no-pop square, addend order
  dz,dy,dx). 98.5% / 93.3% / 66.7% unchanged, FUN_000f9c40 89.1% -> 89.0%.

Two rules learned about the VC71 lane, both now encoded in `src/x87_math.h`:

1. cl.exe honours an explicit `(float)` cast on a float expression as a forced
   store/reload. Narrowing casts in shared source must go through
   `HALO_NARROW(e)`, which is `(float)(e)` under clang and `(e)` under cl.exe.
2. A named temporary for a value the reference keeps in ST(i) makes cl.exe spill
   it. Promote the expression in place (`(x87_wide_t)a * b + ...`) instead of
   introducing a variable.

Checker caveats confirmed by the audits: `fstp st(k)` / `fst` leak the
"computed" flag (false EXTRA counts on exact copies), and reloads through
`fmul/fsub/fadd dword [slot]` are invisible, so the EXTRA-NARROWING counts on
these functions are mostly qword (53-bit) spills of the promoted temporaries
and exact float copies, not 24-bit roundings.

Client redeployed with all of the above; host image unchanged. Run 10/11 pending.

## RUN 10 (2026-09-07) — per-tick drift in the free-flight integration

Tick 1184, the LOS-flip class again: projectile `e2b80007` got hit-at-t=0 on
the host and miss on the client, its radius_hit z already 0.018 apart
(`404bf27e` vs `404d1060`). Walking the whole ring instead of the divergent
tick showed the real picture:

- **Every** grenade detonation origin (kind 34) differed between host and
  client from the earliest surviving explosion at tick 810: 4-11 ulp in x/y
  for grenades that never bounced, thousands of ulp after a bounce.
- An **airborne biped** (`e2780009`, a jumping player, ticks 992-1003) was
  ~2e-5 off in z with the gap growing slowly per tick, while every grounded
  biped stayed bit-identical.

So this is not a collision-branch flip but a rounding mismatch inside the
per-tick flight integration itself, shared by projectiles and airborne units.
Two instruction-level audits (projectile update `FUN_000f9c40`, biped physics
step `FUN_001a2f40`) plus a callgraph check found:

1. **`FUN_000f9c40` air-drag arm** (projectiles.c ~2544): the original does
   `FSTP dword` on each scaled velocity component (0xfa270/78/7e) and reloads
   the narrowed slot for `avg_vel` (0xfa281/8f/9e). clang emitted `FST`
   (no-pop) and averaged the 80-bit product. `avg_vel` feeds `new_pos`
   directly, so the position accumulated a sub-ulp error every tick — the
   observed ramp. Same shape in the split-tick arm (0xfa1fa..0xfa24a) and on
   the bounce path (`time_remaining`, `vel[2]` at 0xfa589/0xfa595). Fixed with
   `HALO_FLT_ROUNDTRIP`.
2. **`FUN_000f9c40` split-tick arm used the wrong variable**: the lift reused
   `decel_frac` for both the "fraction of the tick before the speed floor"
   (0xfa1bb, live in ST(2) through 0xfa210) and `dist_at_hit/speed_prev`,
   so `avg_vel` was scaled by the wrong ratio on the tick a grenade reached
   terminal speed. Now a separate `split_frac`.
3. **`FUN_001a2f40` airborne branch** (bipeds.c ~2996): the original narrows
   `damp*c0` (0x1a31c5 FSTP, 0x1a31ce reload) but keeps `damp*c1` wide; we
   kept both wide. `raw0` feeds the new x velocity, hence position, hence the
   next tick's collision query. Fixed with a narrowed `dc0` temporary (a
   named temporary is right here because cl.exe spills it exactly as the
   reference does). Three addend orders in the same function corrected.
4. **SSE1 inlined in the reference**: `FUN_00147ed0` (collision_bsp.c, the
   leaf of the biped sphere walk) computes the vertex distance with
   `subps/mulps/addss`, i.e. every operation rounded to float32 and summed
   x, y, z. Our port called the x87 `distance_squared3d` (64-bit accumulate,
   wide compare). Rewritten with per-op round trips. A scan of every ported
   function's reference body finds only one other SSE user (0x109850,
   already handled with an asm block), so this class is closed. The x87
   narrowing checker is blind to it by construction.

Checker change: `check_x87_narrowing.py` now counts reloads through
`fadd/fsub/fsubr/fmul/fdiv/fdivr/fcom/fcomp dword [slot]`, not only `fld`.
That was the blind spot that hid `t_min/V/b` in `projectile_aim_ballistic`
earlier; it exposes 26 more MISSING functions in units/bipeds/real_math/
objects, none on the free-flight path (callgraph-checked). Counts remain a
NET, so a "0 MISSING" on a large function still needs a slot-level pass.

VC71: FUN_000f9c40 89.0 -> 89.2, FUN_001a2f40 77.0 -> 77.2, FUN_00147ed0
91.1 -> 89.0 (cl.exe cannot emit the SSE sequence; accepted).

Next suspect if the airborne drift survives run 11: `FUN_0014f2c0`
(collision_usage.c) slot-by-slot with the `HALO_FLT_ROUNDTRIP` barriers
excluded from the metric — its net +21 EXTRA masks whatever is left.

Client redeployed; host image unchanged. Run 11 pending.

## RUN 11 (2026-09-07) — drift smaller, not gone; toggle bisect deployed

With all run-10 fixes in the client (build 15:27), the first RNG divergence
moved to tick 788/789: a grenade bounce (`FUN_000f90d0` draws) landed one tick
late on the client, the run-3 class. Position data:

- detonation origin at tick 713: 1 ulp off in x, 19 ulp in y (run 10: 4-11
  ulp before any bounce, thousands after);
- airborne biped `e2780009`: bit-identical for 36 ticks, then diverges;
- grounded biped `e2770008`: 1 ulp off in z from tick 328 after 994
  identical ticks.

The instruction-level audits keep finding partial causes, so the next run is
a **toggle bisect**: the client on 10.0.0.21 (build 15:40) runs with
`FUN_000f9c40` (projectile update) and `FUN_001a2f40` (biped physics step) set
`ported=false` in kb.json — the original bodies execute, still calling our
ported callees. This kb.json change is deliberately NOT committed.

Reading run 12: if the detonation origins (kind 34) become bit-identical, the
remaining projectile mismatch is inside `FUN_000f9c40`'s body; if they still
differ, it is in a callee (`FUN_000f8720`, aim, `object_translate`) or in the
throw setup (unit/weapon code that seeds the initial velocity). Same logic for
the biped drift versus `FUN_001a2f40` / `FUN_0014f2c0`.

Fallback if the bisect is inconclusive: capture a client state snapshot with a
grenade in flight and run `unicorn_diff.py --state-snapshot` on
`FUN_000f9c40` original vs ours with a memory trace, which pinpoints the first
differing store without further static guessing.

## RUN 12 — toggle bisect: the projectile and biped bodies are excluded (2026-09-07)

Run 12 used the bisect client (`FUN_000f9c40` and `FUN_001a2f40` running as
original code, every callee still ours). Rings: `artifacts/rng_trace/ds12_h.json`
/ `ds12_c.json`.

- The bounce is still one tick late: host draws at tick 612, client at 613.
- Detonation origins still differ: host tick 627 `c11a2aa9`/`409a6958`,
  client tick 628 `c11a4032`/`409a3cce`.
- Grounded bipeds still show 1-ulp z differences (`e2770008` from tick 273,
  `e2750006` from tick 609).

So the remaining mismatch is not in either body. What is left for the
projectile is the sweep `FUN_000f8720` and its collision test `FUN_0014df70`
(plus the `collision_bsp` leaves), or the throw setup (initial velocity and
marker position: `object_compute_node_matrices` and the unit/weapon code that
seeds the projectile). For bipeds it is `FUN_0014f2c0` or the same
collision leaves.

### Run 13 setup: per-tick position probes

Rather than audit those by hand, the next run logs the grenade position every
tick on both sides:

- **kind 36 `sweep_pos`**: `FUN_000f8720` entry, value = `new_pos.x` bits,
  caller2 = `new_pos.z` bits. Host detour at `0xf8720` (6-byte prologue
  replayed, cave `impl+0x10` = 0x6eca00, inside the deactivated
  `unit_update_animation` body); client `RNG_TRACE_EX` at the top of our
  `FUN_000f8720`.
- **kind 33 widened**: the LOS-exit detour now also logs calls returning into
  `0xf8720..0xf8920`, with value bit 31 set to separate them from the
  area-damage callers. The cave at `impl+0x268` was rewritten in place
  (147 bytes, still below `impl+0x300`). Client mirror: `SWEEP_LOS()` in
  `projectiles.c` wraps both `FUN_0014df70` calls and logs kind 33 with bit 31.

Host image v3 (`build_original_probes_v3.py`, sha `ad146cd8...`, 10 patches)
deployed to 10.0.0.24 after the run-12 ring was dumped. The client keeps the
two `ported=false` toggles (still uncommitted) so any position difference is
attributable to the sweep, the collision test, or the throw setup.

Reading run 13: the first tick where `sweep_pos` differs is where the input
to the sweep first differs (throw setup or the previous tick's integration);
a tick where `sweep_pos` matches but the flagged kind-33 result or `t` differs
puts the mismatch inside `FUN_000f8720` / `FUN_0014df70`.

## September 11 continuation: coherent grenade-chain runtime bisect

The later ds63--ds68 mixed-build runs used client `10.0.0.21` with the RNG
trace build and pristine host probe v7 on `10.0.0.25`. The watcher stopped
both guests, then the rings were dumped while paused and aligned by RNG draw
identity rather than by sampled tick.

Confirmed exclusions:

- ds63: `object_translate` plus `object_try_place` original did not prevent
  the first sweep-position or later damage/RNG divergence.
- ds64: `projectile_new` original did not prevent it.
- ds65: `object_new` original did not prevent it.
- ds66: `unit_throw_grenade_move_to_hand` original did not prevent it.
- ds67: `object_attach_to_parent` original did not prevent it.
- ds68: `unit_throw_grenade_release` original did not prevent it.

These are outer-body exclusions only: an original function called at its XBE
address still reaches any callees whose addresses are redirected to lifted
implementations. Therefore the individual toggles do not exclude each complete
subtree.

In ds68 the first observed grenade sweep already differed in XY while Z and
all velocity components were bit-identical. Client new position was
`(-1.9115324, -0.5758146, 1.9720049)`; host was
`(-1.9347463, -0.6052260, 1.9720049)`. The later RNG split was collision
timing: the client entered `FUN_000f90d0` at tick 578 and the host at tick
583. Damage/collision branching amplifies the position difference; it is not
yet proven to be the first writer.

### ds69 pristine/pristine control and watcher limitation

Both sides ran the same cachebeta-derived probe v7. The watcher eventually
paused them after observing different seeds in snapshots nominally two ticks
apart. This was a watcher false positive, not an RNG sequence divergence:

- event alignment found 1,187 identical shared RNG/caller events;
- 16,296 shared throw, sweep, damage, radius, and LOS probe records were
  bit-identical;
- one ring merely contained one later RNG event.

The watcher remains useful for stopping close to a suspected event, but its
`seed mismatch` message is not proof unless the dumped rings differ after
sequence alignment. This A/A control also proves that the mixed-build
throw/sweep differences are not ordinary host/client role skew.

### ds70 setup: coherent original grenade boundary

The next client build disables the full currently identified grenade boundary
as one diagnostic unit: `unit_throw_grenade_move_to_hand`,
`unit_throw_grenade_release`, `unit_set_seat_state`,
`object_get_markers_by_string_id`, `object_placement_data_new`,
`object_new`, `projectile_new`, `object_attach_to_parent`,
`object_detach_from_parent`, `object_translate`, `object_try_place`,
`FUN_000f8720`, and `FUN_0014df70`. The toggles are build-only and are
restored in `kb.json` after the diagnostic XBE is copied.

Correction: this boundary omitted the per-tick projectile integrator
`FUN_000f9c40` and motion/collision helper `FUN_0014f2c0`; therefore ds70
cannot by itself place the first writer upstream of grenade creation.

### ds70 result and ds71 corrected lifecycle setup

ds70 still diverged. At tick 577 both sides shared five draws, then the client
entered `projectile_accelerate` while the host made another
`object_cause_damage` draw. The first recorded explosion origin differed:
client `(-3.8918023, 2.0774932)`, host
`(-3.8970609, 2.0403311)`. This confirms different projectile state at
detonation, but not when it was first written because ds70 left the per-tick
integrator active.

ds71 adds `FUN_000f9c40` and `FUN_0014f2c0` to every ds70 deactivation, so
construction, placement, flight integration, sweep, collision motion, and LOS
all execute pristine bodies. If ds71 still diverges, inspect the initial
throw/unit state. If it synchronizes, bisect the lifecycle boundary.

### ds71 result and ds72 biped-writer setup

ds71 still produced a true same-tick sequence divergence at tick 170. The
client made additional `object_cause_damage` draws where the host entered
`projectile_accelerate`, followed by different victim counts on both sides.
The first explosion origin remained different despite the pristine grenade
lifecycle: client `(-1.3148494, 1.6100744)`, host
`(-1.3495448, 1.5957612)`. The grenade Z values observed by the radius query
were `3.1916511` and `3.1987424`, respectively.

This places the surviving input difference before or outside the disabled
grenade lifecycle. ds72 retains every ds71 deactivation and additionally
disables biped physics writer `FUN_001a2f40`. This closes the important gap
in run 12: that run disabled the projectile and biped bodies together but left
their shared collision-motion helper `FUN_0014f2c0` patched.
